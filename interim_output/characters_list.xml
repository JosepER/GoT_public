<p><b>Ned Stark</b> (season 1, 6-7) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Sean_Bean" title="Sean Bean">Sean Bean</a> in season 1 as an adult, and by <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Croft" title="Sebastian Croft">Sebastian Croft</a> in season 6 as a child, and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Aramayo" title="Robert Aramayo">Robert Aramayo</a> in season 6 and 7 as a young adult. Eddard "Ned" Stark of House Stark, <a href="/wiki/Lord" title="Lord">Lord</a> of Winterfell and Warden of the North, becomes the Hand of the King after Lord Jon Arryn's death. He is known for his sense of honor and justice. He took part in Robert's Rebellion after his sister Lyanna was kidnapped by Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. When Ned's father and brother went south to reclaim her, the "Mad King" Aerys Targaryen burned both of them alive. Ned and Robert Baratheon led the rebellion to unseat him from the throne. As the show opens, Ned has been content to remain in the north, but after the death of Lord Jon Arryn, he is convinced that it is his duty to accept the position of Hand of the King. Ned is not interested in politics, and prefers to rule with honor and follow the law. While investigating the reason for the death of Jon Arryn, he discovers that all three of Robert's children with Queen Cersei were fathered by Cersei's twin brother Jaime. When Ned confronts Cersei about the truth, she has him imprisoned for treason after he publicly denounces Joffrey. Ned is convinced by Varys that if he goes to his death honorably, as he is prepared to do, his daughters will suffer for it. To protect them, he sacrifices his honor and publicly declares that he was plotting to steal the throne and that Joffrey is the true king. Despite Cersei's promise that Ned would be allowed to join the Night's Watch in exile, Joffrey orders Ned's execution for his own amusement and later torments Sansa by forcing her to look at her father's head. His bones are later returned to Catelyn in the Stormlands by Petyr Baelish, who laments Ned's downfall and that he was too honorable to seize power through force, rather insisting the throne pass to Lord Stannis Baratheron, Robert's younger brother. Baelish's preferred course of action, revealed only to Ned, had been to seize Cersei and her children first and rule in Joffrey's name as Regent and Lord Protector. Ned's execution, however, is not in vain, since he notifies Stannis of the truth of Joffrey's parentage, and Stannis informs all of Westeros, which sets into motion the War of Five Kings against House Lannister.</p>

<p><b>Robert Baratheon</b> (season 1) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Mark_Addy" title="Mark Addy">Mark Addy</a>. Robert Baratheon of House Baratheon, formerly a fierce warrior, became <a href="/wiki/Monarch" title="Monarch">King</a> of the Seven Kingdoms after leading a rebellion against Aerys II Targaryen. He was betrothed to Ned Stark's sister Lyanna and loved her deeply, and she was kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen. Her father and another brother were killed when they went to King's Landing to reclaim her, which resulted in Robert and Ned Stark's revolt known as Robert's Rebellion, whereupon the Targaryens were all slaughtered or routed from the Kingdoms. Since Robert's family had closer ties to the former Royal family, this put Robert on the Iron Throne. Now, Robert has grown fat and miserable; he has no more wars to fight, is surrounded by plotters and sycophants, hates and is bored by the constant work needed to manage the Kingdoms properly, and trapped in a political marriage to the scheming Cersei Lannister, whom he has never loved. He is unaware that none of his three children are his, but instead Jaime Lannister's. Under his reign, the realm has been bankrupted, and Robert is deeply in debt to his wife's family. Killed while hunting, he unknowingly leaves no rightful heir behind. His bastards are ordered dead by Joffrey, many of which are killed, and Gendry is subsequently forced to flee the capital.</p>

<p><b>Jaime Lannister</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Nikolaj_Coster-Waldau" title="Nikolaj Coster-Waldau">Nikolaj Coster-Waldau</a>. Ser Jaime Lannister of House Lannister is a member of the Kingsguard and an exceptionally skilled <a href="/wiki/Swordsmanship" title="Swordsmanship">swordsman</a>. He is the Queen's twin brother and has carried on an incestuous love affair with her all his life, fathering all three of her living children. He truly does love his sister and will do anything, no matter how rash, to stay close to her. He is nicknamed "Kingslayer" for killing the previous King, Aerys II, whom he was sworn to protect. He was allowed to keep his post in the current Kingsguard as he and his influential father helped Robert win the war, but no one feels he deserves this post, which frustrates Jaime. Despite Eddard Stark's animosity against him for forsaking his oath to protect the King during Robert's Rebellion, Jaime has great respect for Eddard, whom he considers a great warrior and his equal. Unlike his father and sister, Jaime cares deeply about his younger brother Tyrion. In Season 2, Catelyn releases and sends Jaime to King's Landing under Brienne of Tarth's watch in exchange for a pledge to send her daughters home. On the journey, they are captured by the violent Locke, a man-at-arms under Roose Bolton, a Northern Lord. On their way to Harrenhal, now held by Bolton, the lowborn Locke cuts off Jaime's sword hand to taunt his position and privilege. Jaime survives and is allowed to depart Harrenhal on condition that he acquits Bolton from any guilt. During his time in Harrenhal, Jaime reveals to Brienne on why he killed King Aerys II. Once freed, Jaime travels to King's Landing with Brienne and disgraced Maester Qyburn, given by Bolton to tend to his injury, in tow. At the end of Season 3, they arrive at the gates and Jaime reunites with Cersei. In season 4, Jaime is fitted with a golden prosthetic hand and given a new sword, and is trained by Bronn in fencing with his left hand. Jaime is one of the few people in King's Landing who believe in Tyrion's innocence in killing Joffrey, and does his best to comfort his younger brother, while outright refusing Cersei's order to kill Tyrion before his trial. When Tyrion is sentenced to death, Jaime frees Tyrion from captivity and arranges for him to be smuggled to Essos with Varys's help. Jaime tells Cersei that he will travel to Dorne and bring Myrcella back. Myrcella says that she likes it in Dorne and doesn't want to go back to King's Landing. However, she eventually leaves with her uncle and Trystane, after Doran bargains to have his son take his seat on the Small Council. On the journey home, Jaime reveals his incestuous relationship to Cersei to their daughter, who then reveals she knows and is glad that Jaime is her father and hugs him, but moments later Myrcella collapses from poison and dies. In season 6, Jaime returns to King's Landing with Myrcella's body and sends Doran a letter requesting the heads of Ellaria, Obara, Nymeria and Tyene, but later hears that both Doran and Trystane were killed by the Sands. In response to Cersei's humiliation by the Faith Militant, Jaime ponders murdering the High Sparrow and marching on the Great Sept of Baelor with the army of House Tyrell to forcibly rescue Margaery from custody. He is foiled, however, when Tommen declares an allegiance between the Faith and the Crown, and dismisses Jaime from the Kingsguard, clearly on the High Sparrow's orders. Jaime is later sent to the Riverlands with Bronn to oversee the surrender of Riverrun. He parleys with Brynden "The Blackfish" Tully, to no avail, and then falsely threatens Edmure Tully with the murder of his baby son if he does not get his men to surrender the castle. The castle eventually falls to the Lannisters and Freys. Jaime briefly crosses paths with Brienne and Podrick, but allows them to leave peacefully. He returns to King's Landing shortly after the Great Sept's destruction, and enters the Red Keep to see Cersei being crowned Queen. In Season 7 he commands the Lannister army, capturing Highgarden but suffering defeat when ambushed by Daenerys' Dothraki forces and dragons. He clashes with Cersei over the threat from the Army of the Dead, and when she breaks her word over sending military support he leaves her and rides north alone.</p>

<p><b>Catelyn Stark</b> (season 1–3) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Michelle_Fairley" title="Michelle Fairley">Michelle Fairley</a>. Catelyn Stark of House Stark and House Tully (née Tully), Lady of Winterfell, is the wife of Lord Eddard Stark. Born to the Lord and Lady of the Riverlands, she is the elder sister of Lysa Arryn, Lady of the Vale and Mistress of the Eyrie, and Lord Edmure Tully, Lord of Riverrun. After deducing that the Lannisters are responsible for the attempt on Bran Stark's life, she travels to King's Landing to warn Ned, and on her return trip has a chance encounter with Tyrion Lannister. Since Catelyn does not know about Tyrion's complete innocence, she decides to take him captive because she believes that he is behind the attempt on her son's life. She takes him to her sister, Lysa Arryn, so that he can be brought to justice but is not successful, as Tyrion is found innocent after a trial by combat. After her husband is arrested and her eldest son Robb goes to war for his release, she joins her son's war council. Upon learning that her husband was executed by orders of King Joffrey, she vows to her son Robb that the Lannister family will pay with their lives. Throughout Season 2, she aids her son Robb in the rebellion by advising him and attempting to broker alliances. While trying to form an alliance with Renly Baratheon, another claimant to the Iron Throne, she takes Brienne of Tarth into her service as an armswoman after Renly's assassination. She frees Jaime Lannister, a valuable hostage to the Starks, in an attempt to exchange him for her captive daughters. Robb, feeling betrayed by what his mother has done, puts her under house arrest. Catelyn travels north with her son to her father's funeral at her childhood home of Riverrun. She is killed in the Red Wedding Massacre after her desperate (and futile) pleas to the Freys to spare her son, threatening to slit Lady Frey's throat if Robb dies. She keeps her promise, and is herself killed moments later when "Black" Walder Frey cuts her throat to the bone. In Season 4, it is stated that her body was stripped naked and thrown into the river after the massacre as a mockery of House Tully's funeral traditions. Though House Stark is stripped of all lands and titles by House Lannister as a result of Robb's death and his ultimately failed rebellion against the Iron Throne, Catelyn and her son are later avenged in Season 6 and the first episode of Season 7 when her eldest daughter Sansa Stark and Sansa's half brother Jon Snow successfully overthrow House Bolton and retake Winterfell and Jon is crowned the King in the North by the remaining Northern lords, wildlings, and Knights of the Vale, restoring Stark rule in the North in the process, while her youngest daughter Arya Stark returns to Westeros, murders Walder Frey, and later uses his face to disguise herself as him to poison all his sons and male descendants at the Twins, ultimately avenging the Red Wedding and exterminating House Frey.</p>

<p><b>Cersei Lannister</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Lena_Headey" title="Lena Headey">Lena Headey</a>. Cersei Lannister of House Lannister and House Baratheon, <a href="/wiki/Queen_consort" title="Queen consort">Queen</a> of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, is the wife of <a href="/wiki/Monarch" title="Monarch">King</a> Robert Baratheon. Her father arranged the marriage when she was a teenager, initiating himself as a political counselor for King Robert. The Lannisters are the richest family in Westeros,<sup id="cite_ref-VanDerWerff_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-VanDerWerff-15">[15]</a></sup> which is why Robert was interested in a marriage between them. Cersei has a twin brother, Jaime, with whom she has been involved in an incestuous affair from early childhood. All three of Cersei's children are Jaime's.<sup id="cite_ref-VanDerWerff_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-VanDerWerff-15">[15]</a></sup> Cersei's main character attribute is her desire for power and her deep loyalty to her father, children, and brother Jaime. Cersei learns that her husband Robert is in danger of finding out that the children he sees as his heirs to the throne are not his. Robert meets his end as the result of a boar attack on a hunting trip, before Ned Stark tells him of the truth about his children. Cersei works quickly to instate her oldest son, Joffrey, on the throne, with her as his chief political advisor and Queen Regent.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Joffrey quits listening to his mother, and by the beginning of the second season her father decides Cersei does not exercise enough control over her son, and her father sends his youngest son Tyrion as an additional political advisor. Cersei and Tyrion do not get along, and constantly try to undermine each other's authority over the crown. As of the end of season 2, Tyrion has accumulated more sway over the Iron Throne, and has shipped Cersei's only daughter off against Cersei's will to be married to the prince of Dorne. In season 3, she takes pleasure in Tyrion's diminished position and taunts him for being forced into a marriage pact with Sansa Stark, only to be told by her father that he intends to marry her to Loras Tyrell. At the end of the season, the two siblings ponder at their respective marriages, and Cersei reunites with Jaime in her bedchamber as he unexpectedly returns from captivity. In season 4, she has Tyrion arrested after Joffrey is fatally poisoned. It is implied that she knows Tyrion's guilt is highly unlikely, but just wants to see him dead, though Jaime refuses to carry out the order.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Indeed, at Tyrion's trial, it is obvious that Cersei has manipulated the entire procedure so that the only witnesses (herself, Lord Varys, Meryn Trant, Grand Maester Pycelle and Shae) give either incomplete or entirely false testimonies to implicate Tyrion and Sansa further in the murder. When Tyrion demands a trial by combat, Cersei quickly chooses Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane as her champion to diminish Tyrion's chances of acquittal, and has Bronn betrothed to a noblewoman so that Tyrion cannot choose him as his champion. Cersei's wish comes true when Tyrion's champion, Oberyn Martell, is killed by Clegane, but she still refuses to marry Loras, even threatening her father with revealing the truth about her relationship with Jaime and the parentage of her children. Tywin rebuffs her threats, though he himself is killed by an escaping Tyrion soon afterwards. Cersei attends Tywin's funeral and later orders a bounty on Tyrion's head. Cersei and Jaime receive a message from Dorne: a small viper statue with a necklace in its fangs. Cersei tells Jaime that the necklace belongs to their daughter, Myrcella, who was sent to Dorne by Tyrion. Jaime tells Cersei that he will travel to Dorne and bring Myrcella back. Cersei meets with two hunters who have brought her a severed head, though she is disappointed to find that it is not Tyrion's head. Qyburn lays claim to the head for his research and the two walk to a small council meeting. With the office of Hand of the King vacant, Cersei tells the council that she will stand in temporarily until Tommen chooses a new Hand. She appoints Mace Tyrell as the new Master of Coin and Qyburn as the new Master of Whisperers. When Cersei tries to appoint her uncle Kevan as the Master of War, he declines, telling her that as the queen mother she holds no power, and has no interest in serving in a council filled with her sycophants. In defiance of Cersei's "orders", Kevan states that he will return to Casterly Rock until he hears direct word from Tommen that he is required. Tommen soon weds Margaery Tyrell. Under Margaery's influence, Tommen drops hints that he would like Cersei to return to Casterly Rock, but she refuses, and confronts Margaery, who insults her. Cersei catches the High Septon being punished for entering a brothel by her cousin Lancel, who has become a member of the Faith Militant, an extremist group that worships the Seven. Cersei talks to their leader, the High Sparrow, and instates him as the new High Septon. The Faith Militant then aggressively puncture all barrels of wine and trash Petyr Baelish's brothel. They also arrest Margaery's brother Loras on the grounds of his homosexuality. Tommen, at Margaery's insistence, tries to get Cersei to release Loras, but Cersei swears she had nothing to do with it. After a trial, Loras is arrested after a prostitute named Olyvar testifies against Loras. Margaery is also arrested for lying about Loras' sexual orientation, and both are put in dungeons. All of this delights Cersei, who goes to see Margaery in her cell and brings her a bowl of venison stew. Cersei has one final talk with the High Sparrow about the accomplishments of the pair, but he soon reveals that Lancel has confessed everything (in Season 1, Cersei had sex with him in Jaime's absence). Cersei is subsequently arrested for adultery, incest, and murder (it was her plan to get Robert drunk so that he would injure himself while hunting). She is only visited in her cell by Qyburn, who tells her that Grand Maester Pycelle has seized power of the throne, and that Kevan is serving as hand of the king. Cersei is distraught to learn that Tommen, anguished over his wife's and mother's arrests, has not been eating. Cersei is also visited by a septa, who orders her to confess to her sins. Cersei refuses, and she is hit by the septa. Weakened, Cersei is forced to lick the water off the floors of the cell. She eventually agrees to reveal herself to the High Septon, confessing her incestuous relationship to Lancel Lannister but refusing to admit more serious offences, which would be harder for the Faith to prove. The High Sparrow allows her to leave captivity in favor of house arrest in the Red Keep, pending the trial, but only if she agrees to do "atonement" for her sins by being shaved and walking naked through the streets of King's Landing. Cersei endures the walk with great resolve, bleeding and covered in filth as she eventually reaches the Keep, where she reunites with her uncle Kevan, now Hand of the King, and Qyburn, who introduces her to the newest member of the Kingsguard, a freakishly large, silent giant implied to be the reanimated corpse of Gregor Clegane. In season 6, Cersei remains under house arrest and is not allowed to attend the funeral of Myrcella, who was ultimately killed by Ellaria Sand. Though her initial plan is to demand a trial by combat and name Gregor as her champion, she is foiled when Tommen falls under the control of the High Sparrow and abolishes the practice, stripping Cersei of her trump card. In desperation, Cersei has Qyburn look into an "old rumour", which turns out to be the Mad King's wildfire caches. On the day of her and Loras's trial, Cersei destroys the Great Sept of Baelor with the wildfire and kills hundreds of people, including Margaery, Loras, Mace Tyrell, Kevan, Lancel, the High Sparrow and the entire Faith Militant, and also has Grand Maester Pycelle killed in his chambers. With her enemies out of the way, Cersei crowns herself Queen and names Qyburn as her Hand. In Season 7 Cersei consolidates her position through alliances with the Tarlys and with Euron Greyjoy, who help her to capture Highgarden, destroy much of Daenerys' fleet and take revenge on Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes. She tells Jamie she is pregnant and it pleases him when she says that she will name him as the father. Cersei agrees to Tyrion's request for a parley with the Targaryen party, and is visibly shocked by the wight that has been brought south. She agrees to send a military force north to help the fight against the Army of the Dead, but reveals to Jamie that she has no intention of keeping her word. Jamie argues, and although Cersei threatens to have him killed she takes no action against him as he leaves her to go north.</p>

<p><b>Daenerys Targaryen</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Emilia_Clarke" title="Emilia Clarke">Emilia Clarke</a>. Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled <a href="/wiki/Princess" title="Princess">princess</a> of the <a href="/wiki/House_Targaryen" class="mw-redirect" title="House Targaryen">Targaryen dynasty</a>. Also called "the Stormborn", she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert's Rebellion. For seventeen years, she has been under the care of Viserys, whom she fears, as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him. In exchange for an army, Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo, making her a Khaleesi, a queen of the Dothraki. Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language, she manages to get past their barriers. She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man. After embracing the Dothraki culture, she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother. She later becomes pregnant with Drogo's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the "Stallion Who Mounts the World". After her brother's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon, Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son. However, during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman. Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic. Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo, leaving him in a permanent catatonic state, and forcing Daenerys to end her husband's life. Losing both her husband and son, Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake. She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo's body, then steps into the burning funeral pyre. After the fire extinguishes itself, the Khaleesi and three baby dragons, named Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion, are found alive and unharmed. Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne. She becomes the first female Dothraki leader. In Season 2, she is lost in the Red Waste, a stretch of barren land. She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth, where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros. When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree, she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them, killing Pyat Pree. In the second season's finale, she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree. Her horde loot Xaro's mansion to buy a ship. Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor, a city in Slaver's Bay, where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied. She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy, and accepts him into her queensguard. On her departure from the city, she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders. By the end of Season 3, although her power has not yet been tested, she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai, her remaining Dothraki brethren (and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki, who advise her) 2,000 'Second Sons' cavalrymen, 8,000 'Unsullied' elite infantry, and three rapidly growing dragons. The stay in Slaver's Bay has made her question her motives, however, and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well, donning the honorific "Breaker of Chains" as the slaves hold her to the sky, praising her as their <i>Mhysa</i>, or "Mother". Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen, the last of the slave cities in Slaver's Bay, but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons, especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food. Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet, Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being. She eventually learns of Jorah's original purpose, which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon, and orders him to leave Meereen on threat of execution. After she receives too many complaints about her dragons, Daenerys, locks Rhaegal and Viserion of them in the catacombs beneath Meereen before searching for Drogon. Meanwhile, Daenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy, a resistance movement against her and the Unsullied. She considers freeing her dragons, but they attempt to attack her, making her realize that they are no longer loyal to her. After Daario and Grey Worm arrest a member of the Sons of the Harpy, Mossador implores Daenerys to execute their captive, but Barristan tells her of the Mad King's actions against his enemies, which included burning them with wildfire while laughing. He asks her not to execute the captive without a fair trial, and she agrees with him. Mossador goes against her wishes, and kills the captive Son of the Harpy. Daenerys has him publicly executed, which leads a riot to break out between the old masters and the freed slaves. At night, Daenerys finds that Drogon has returned, but when she tries to touch his face, he flies away. Soon afterward, a group of Unsullied patrolling the streets of Meereen are stopped by a crying woman who points them to an alleyway. The Unsullied head in to investigate, but it is revealed that the entire affair was a set up after they are soon cornered by a group of the Sons of the Harpy. The Unsullied attempt to fight back, but the Sons of the Harpy kill many of them. Barristan Selmy sees the commotion and tries to help, killing many of the Sons of the Harpy, but gets badly wounded, and dies. Grey Worm also sustains serious but nonfatal injuries. Daenerys is furious after learning what has happened to Barristan, and rounds up the leaders of the great Meereenese houses. She takes them into the catacombs where she randomly has one of them shoved forward. The Meereenese lord is promptly killed by dragonfire from Rhaegal, and he and Viserion eat him. Daenerys then has all the lords arrested, including her former adviser Hizdahr zo Loraq, whom she decides to marry to win over the Meereenese nobles. To respect the culture of the region, she agrees to have the fighting pits reinstated (she had previously declined due to her distaste for killing for sport). Hizdahr convinces Daenerys to go to one of the pits to see the contestants battling over who will go to the final competition. Daenerys is sickened by the bloodshed, and gets up to leave, but her attention is turned by one masked competitor who defeats all of the other competitors without killing any of them. This competitor turns out to be Jorah Mormont, who is trying to win over Daenerys' favor after being banished. Daenerys orders the Unsullied to take him away, but Jorah announces that he has brought her a gift, and Tyrion Lannister reveals himself to Daenerys. After a round of questioning, Daenerys banishes Jorah once again, but takes Tyrion on as her adviser. On the great opening of Daznak's Pit, Jorah resurfaces as a voluntary contender on the arena, but Daenerys refuses to stop the games to spare his life. Jorah eventually prevails and saves her life by impaling with his spear an attacker from the Sons of the Harpy, who appear in legions and attack Daenerys' guards. Cornered at the midst of the arena, defeat seems immediate when Drogon returns, killing many Sons of the Harpy despite being wounded by several of their spears. Daenerys manages to rekindle their bond and climbs his back, riding off into the distance to a stunned crowd. She roams the Great Steppe north of the city, where Drogon seems reluctant to obey her commands or even hunt for food. Strolling about on her own, Daenerys is faced with an incoming Dothraki khalasar of great numbers, and after dropping a ring to the ground to leave a trail, she is surrounded. In season 6, the Dothraki take her to Vaes Dothrak, where she identifies herself to Khal Moro as Drogo's former wife. Out of respect for Dothraki traditions, they take Daenerys to join the Dosh Khaleen, which consisted of the wives of deceased khals. Daenerys refuses and instead burns the temple down with herself and all the khals still inside. She emerges unscathed, and the awed Dothraki accept her as their new leader. She returns to Meereen with her new army and destroys the slaver fleet assaulting the city with her dragons. In the aftermath, Daenerys meets with Theon and Yara Greyjoy, who offer their support for her claim so that they can overthrow their uncle Euron. Daenerys accepts their aid and secures help from the Reach and Dorne, names Tyrion as her hand, but breaks up with Daario, ordering him to stay behind and govern Slaver's Bay in her absence. With her new army, Daenerys finally sets sail for Westeros. In Season 7 Daenerys finally uses her dragons in battle, annihilating a Lannister force and their baggage train with fire. Daenerys welcomes Jon Snow to Dragonstone, seeing him as a friend and ally, insisting that he bend the knee to her but exhibiting patience with his refusal. She believes his tales of white walkers and agrees to let him mine dragonglass (obsidian) from her land. When Jon's expedition north of the Wall gets into trouble Daenerys takes her dragons to rescue them, and is devastated when the Night King kills one. On the ship back to Dragonstone she and Jon make love.</p>

<p><b>Jorah Mormont</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Iain_Glen" title="Iain Glen">Iain Glen</a>. Ser Jorah Mormont of House Mormont is an exiled <a href="/wiki/Knight" title="Knight">knight</a> in the service of Daenerys Targaryen and the son of Jeor Mormont of the Night's Watch. To fund his wife's extravagant lifestyle, he sold poachers on his land to slave traders, which is illegal in the Seven Kingdoms. Rather than face punishment by Lord Stark, he fled to Essos and learned the lifestyle of the Dothraki who embrace him as one of their own and know him as "Jorah The Andal". Jorah serves as an adviser to the Targaryens on both political and cultural matters of both the Seven Kingdoms and Essos. Jorah is actually spying on the Targaryens for Lord Varys in exchange for a pardon on his crimes. But after learning more about Daenerys, Jorah falls in love with her and decides to protect and help her regain the Iron Throne. After she is widowed, he remains with her and becomes the first knight of her Queensguard. He serves Daenerys as an adviser throughout Season 2 and tries to help her claim her birthright as queen of the Seven Kingdoms. In Season 3, he plays an important part in the capture of Yunkai, together with Unsullied commander Grey Worm and Daario Naharis, Lieutenant and leader of the Second Sons. Led by Daario, the trio infiltrates the city and kills a number of Yunkish guards to open a gate, ensuring the capture of Yunkai. Jorah later assists Daenerys and her army in conquering Meereen, and later informs her of Joffrey's death, but at the same time dissuades her from invading King's Landing, since she is not strong enough to take all of Westeros yet. When Daenerys appears to begin a romantic relationship with Daario, Jorah voices his disapproval. Daenerys eventually discovers that Jorah's original mission was to spy on her for the "usurper" Robert Baratheon, which led to her and her unborn son almost being killed by the wine merchant in Vaes Dothrak, and exiles him from Meereen on the threat of death. Jorah subsequently departs alone. He runs into Tyrion Lannister in Volantis, kidnapping him to deliver to "the Queen", meaning Daenerys. Sailing through the ruins of Valyria, the couple are assaulted by stone men long decayed by greyscale, and Jorah is seemingly infected by the disease as one of the stone men touches his hand. He drags Tyrion safely to land, where the couple are captured by pirates. Tyrion convinces them to take them to Meereen to be sold as slaves in the fighting pits, where they are bought by master Yezzan zo Qaggaz, and successfully escape during a tourney. Upon seeing Jorah again, Daenerys orders him taken away. Tyrion manages to convince her of his worth and urges her to take him as her adviser, upon which he advises her, correctly in his opinion, to have Ser Jorah banished for his treason, having concealed the true nature of his service to her although he had several chances of doing so. Jorah is exiled a second time, and returns to Yezzan, wishing to fight in the pits before the Queen to see. He does so, and eventually emerges as the victor; brandishing his spear, he impales an assassin from the Sons of the Harpy about to stab Daenerys, and protects her as she is forced to flee into the pit as more harpies emerge. They are eventually saved by Drogon, who absconds Daenerys on his back, and Jorah resolutely decides to track her into the wild to wherever she has gone, joined by Daario Naharis, while Tyrion stays behind to govern Meereen. They track her to Vaes Dothrak and witness Daenerys kill all the khals and take control of the Dothraki. Daenerys, however, learns of Jorah's greyscale infection, and orders him to find a cure and then rejoin her cause. At the Citadel in Oldtown, Samwell Tarly defies orders to subject Jorah to a dangerous and painful cure. It is successful and Jorah returns to Daenerys, who revokes his banishment. Jorah goes north of the Wall with Jon Snow to capture a wight. He refuses Jon's attempt to gift him Longclaw, the Mormonts' ancestral valerian steel sword, as he had brought dishonour on the Mormont name.</p>

<p><b>Petyr Baelish</b> (season 1–7) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Aidan_Gillen" title="Aidan Gillen">Aidan Gillen</a>. <a href="/wiki/Lord" title="Lord">Lord</a> Petyr Baelish, nicknamed "Littlefinger," is the Master of Coin in King Robert Baratheon's Small Council. He grew up with Catelyn Tully and fought Ned's brother Brandon for her hand. Petyr is a master manipulator who knows the ongoing affairs within the Seven Kingdoms thanks to his spies. While Petyr at first is assumed to be an ally of Ned, he secretly resents him for marrying Catelyn and so he betrayed him when he tried to arrest Joffrey and Cersei. Despite that, Petyr aims to take the Iron Throne to punish the powerful nobles who used to look down on him. During season 2, he convinces Catelyn to release Jaime in exchange for her daughters and brokers an alliance between House Lannister and House Tyrell. He then returns to King's Landing with the Tyrell army in time to rescue the city. For his efforts, he is made Lord of Harrenhal, though the castle is held by Northmen. In Season 3, he discovers Ros is secretly working for Varys and gives her to Joffrey to be killed before departing to the Eyrie, where he is to marry Lysa Arryn to secure her loyalty to the Iron Throne. He will thence be Lord Paramount of both the Vale (as Lysa Arryn's consort) and the Riverlands (after the downfall of the Tullys at the Red Wedding), though he has yet to see Harrenhal. In Season 4, Littlefinger returns in secret to the area around King's Landing. He has spent weeks in the Vale, and is confirmed to be getting married to Lysa. Petyr helps Olenna Tyrell orchestrate the assassination of King Joffrey at his wedding to Margaery, something Olenna wanted very badly as it would save her granddaughter from Joffrey's beastly nature. This serves to strengthen his new alliance with House Tyrell. Petyr also gets Sansa Stark – Ned and Catelyn's eldest surviving daughter – out of King's Landing by ordering court fool and former knight Dontos Hollard to bring her to him. Under the guise of making payment, Petyr has Dontos killed by his archers to silence him. He also begins acting as a mentor for her, and promises Sansa she is safe with him. When asked what he wants by her, he simply says "everything". When they arrive in the Vale, it is revealed that he and Lysa have been having an affair for quite some time, and that it was Lysa who poisoned Jon Arryn on Petyr's request. Petyr and Lysa marry that same day, and loudly consummate their marriage. However, Petyr later confides to Sansa that the reason he had Joffrey killed was to avenge Catelyn, and goes as far as to kiss her, with Lysa looking on unnoticed. When confronted by Lysa, who in a rage attempted to kill Sansa, Petyr kills Lysa instead, calmly pushing her through the Moon Door – a hole in the floor looking down hundreds of feet to the rocks below the Eyrie, and the preferred method of execution in the Vale of Arryn, incidentally – to her death on the rocks below. Sansa stands up for Petyr when he is questioned by other lords and ladies of the Vale on the matter of Lysa's apparent "suicide," and confirms that Lysa did indeed kill herself, however, and he is cleared of all charges. As the new Lord Paramount of the Vale, Petyr then begins talking the lords and ladies into supporting Lysa's sickly and mentally challenged son, Robin Arryn, though it is implied that his real intention is for Robin to die. In Season 5, Petyr and Sansa depart the Eyrie for a place that Petyr promises Sansa that Cersei will never find her, leaving Robin in the care of Yohn Royce. At an inn Podrick Payne along with Brienne of Tarth sees Petyr and Sansa eating in the back of the inn, guarded by knights. Brienne approaches and pledge her life to Sansa but Petyr accuses her of Renly Baratheon's murder, Brienne explains that Renly was killed by a shadow with Stannis's face. Sansa tells Brienne that she doesn't want her protection, and asks her to leave. Petyr attempts to have his guards take Brienne into their custody, but she flees with Podrick, stealing a horse and releasing several others. Petyr arranges a marriage between Sansa Stark and Ramsay Bolton so that Sansa can return to Winterfell, though Ramsay brutally rapes Sansa on their wedding night despite Ramsay's promise to never harm her. After dropping Sansa off at Winterfell, he leaves for King's Landing, where he provides a prostitute named Olyvar for Cersei to convict Loras Tyrell of his homosexuality. He also promises to march North with the strength of the Vale in his back to depose whatever victor comes out of the struggle between Roose Bolton and Stannis Baratheon, and swears to Cersei to bring her Sansa's head if he succeeds. In return, Cersei promises to make him Warden of the North in addition to already claimed titles of Lord of Harrenhal and Lord Paramount of the Vale. However, Baelish later betrays Cersei by providing Olenna Tyrell with information about her affair with Lancel Lannister, which Olenna then uses to have Cersei arrested by the High Sparrow. In season 6, after hearing of Sansa's escape from Winterfell, Baelish rides North to her aid and apologises for having underestimated Ramsay, but Sansa refuses to believe him and sends him away. However, Baelish later receives a call for help from Sansa to aid her and Jon Snow in retaking Winterfell from Ramsay, and he and the Vale Knights arrive in time to smash the Bolton army and secure victory for the Starks. He later approaches Sansa and admits that he desires to sit on the Iron Throne with Sansa as his Queen, but she turns him down. As Jon is declared the new King in the North, Baelish glares sinisterly at Sansa, clearly intending to take action against them. In season 7 he remains at Winterfell, where he continues to mentor Sansa in political intrigue. He sees Arya as a threat and through manipulation and poisoned words he encourages Sansa and Arya to think the worst of each other. He does not see the threat from Bran, who can see all of his past actions. Baelish is startled to be put on trial for treason and murder. Sansa accuses him of murdering Jon and Lysa Arryn and setting family member against family member. Bran tells that the dagger with which he was nearly killed was Baelish's, and that Baelish put a knife to Ned Stark's throat. Arya waits for Sansa's judgement and then slit's Baelish's throat.</p>

<p><b>Viserys Targaryen</b> (season 1) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Harry_Lloyd" title="Harry Lloyd">Harry Lloyd</a>. Viserys Targaryen is the exiled <a href="/wiki/Prince" title="Prince">prince</a> and heir of the Targaryen dynasty. Known as "The Beggar King" for his search for an army to recapture his throne. A narcissist, he is arrogant and self-centered, caring only about himself and looking down on others especially to his sister Daenerys. In exchange for an army to help regain the Iron Throne, Viserys marries off his sister to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo and follows his horde's journey to the Dothraki capital to ensure Drogo will keep his end of the bargain. But as they journey, it becomes evident that Viserys does not have leadership skills to reclaim the throne as his arrogance and disrespect for the Dothraki does not win him any hearts. Furthermore, Daenerys, who he has always threatened throughout his life, starts to stand up to him. Realizing that Daenerys is loved by the Dothraki and her and Drogo's unborn son is prophet to unite the world, Viserys realizes that it is not he but Daenerys who will reclaim the Iron Throne. In a fit of drunken rage, he threatens Drogo to give him his army now or he will kill his unborn son. Having enough of his behavior, Drogo kills Viserys by giving him a "Golden Crown"; molten gold poured over his head. Daenerys listlessly watches her brother's agonizing death, proclaiming that he wasn't a true dragon, as "fire cannot kill a dragon". Daenerys later names one of her dragons Viserion, as a tribute to Viserys.</p>

<p>Jon Snow of House Stark and the Night's Watch is the secret son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, though raised as the <a href="/wiki/Bastard_(Law_of_England_and_Wales)" class="mw-redirect" title="Bastard (Law of England and Wales)">bastard son</a> of Lyanna's brother, Ned Stark. In the first season, Jon joins the Night's Watch. Jon is a talented fighter, but his sense of compassion and justice brings him into conflict with his harsh surroundings. Ned claims that Jon's mother was a wet nurse named Wylla. His <a href="/wiki/Dire_wolf" title="Dire wolf">dire wolf</a> is called Ghost due to his albinism and quiet nature. Jon soon learns that the Watch is no longer a glorious order, but is now composed mostly of society's rejects, including criminals and exiles. Initially, he has only contempt for his low-born brothers of the Watch, but he puts aside his prejudices and befriends his fellow recruits, especially Samwell Tarly, after they unite against the cruel master-at-arms, Ser Alliser Thorne. He chooses to take his vows before the Old Gods of the North, and to his disappointment he is made steward to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont rather than a ranger. He eventually realizes that he is being groomed for command. He saves Mormont's life by slaying a wight, a corpse resurrected by the White Walkers. In return, he receives Longclaw, the ancestral blade of House Mormont. When Eddard is arrested for treason, Jon is torn between his family and his vows. After Eddard's execution, he tries to join Robb's army but is convinced to come back by his friends. Shortly after, he joins the large force Mormont leads beyond the Wall. Jon is part of a small scouting party in Season 2. When the party is overtaken by wildlings, Jon is ordered to appear to defect and join the wildlings so he can discover their plans. On affirming his loyalty to the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, he travels toward the Wall with the wildlings and is seduced by one, the flame-haired Ygritte. Upon crossing the wall, he refuses to behead a farmer whose escape might alert the Night's Watch of their coming, and is subsequently branded an enemy of the wildlings. Ygritte shields him from her comrades but ultimately confronts and injures Jon when he stops to drink. He manages to escape back to the wall, injured by three arrows, where he reunites with his comrades and informs the commanders of Mance Rayder's plans. Jon subsequently resumes his training at the Wall and suggests an expedition to Craster's Keep in order to kill the Night's Watch mutineers who may tell Mance of the Wall's weak defences if caught. Jon's request is granted and he bands together a group of rangers to aid him, among them the new recruit Locke, who has actually come to kill Jon on Roose Bolton's orders. Jon successfully attacks Craster's Keep and kills the mutineers, while Locke is killed by Hodor during an attempt to kill Bran, who was captive at Craster's Keep. However, Jon's proposal to barricade the entrance to Castle Black to stop the wildlings from entering is denied. He survives the wildling attack on Castle Black, personally killing Styr and taking Tormund Giantsbane prisoner. In the aftermath, he departs Castle Black to hunt down Mance Rayder, giving his sword to Sam. He quickly locates Mance on the pretence of parleying, but he is found out. Before he is killed, however, Jon is saved by the timely arrival by Stannis Baratheon, who places Mance and his men under arrest, and accompanies Jon back to Castle Black. Jon later burns Ygritte's body in the woods. In Season 5, Stannis attempts to use Jon as an intermediary between himself and Mance, hoping to rally the wildling army to help him retake the North from Roose Bolton and gain Jon's support in avenging his family. Jon fails to convince Mance, and when Mance is burned at the stake by Stannis' red priestess Melisandre, Jon shoots him from afar to give him a quick death. After that Jon is chastised by Stannis for showing mercy to Mance. Stannis shows Jon a letter he received from Bear Island, stating that former Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's relatives will only recognize a Stark as their King. Ser Davos tells Jon that the Night's Watch will elect a new Lord Commander that night, and that it is almost assured that Ser Alliser will win. Stannis asks Jon to kneel before him and pledge his life to him, and in exchange he will legitimize Jon, making him Jon Stark, and giving him Winterfell. In the great hall, Jon tells Sam that he will refuse Stannis's offer, as he swore an oath to the Night's Watch. After Ser Alliser and Denys Mallister are announced as possible candidates, Sam gives a speech imploring his brothers to vote for Jon, reminding them all how he led the mission to Craster's Keep to avenge Commander Mormont's death and how he led the defense of Castle Black. After the voting is complete, the ballots are tallied and show a tie between Jon and Ser Alliser. Maester Aemon casts the deciding vote in favor of Jon, making him the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. To lessen the animosity between the two, Jon makes Ser Alliser First Ranger. Melisandre takes an interest in Jon, visiting him in his quarters and trying to have sex with him. Jon refuses, out of respect for Ygritte and his Night's Watch vows. Jon makes plans to give the wildlings the lands south of the wall, known as "the gift." He wants the Night's Watch and the wildlings to unite against the threat of the White Walkers. These more liberal views are not taken well by the men of the Night's Watch, in particular Ser Alliser and a young boy named Olly, whose village was massacred by wildlings. Jon then makes a trip north of the Wall to the wildling village of Hardhome, where he hopes to get the wildlings to join his cause. However, before many of them can get on boats to leave, a massive group of White Walkers arrives on the scene. A massive battle ensues, in which many wildlings are killed. The last remaining Night's Watchmen and wildlings, including Jon, depart from Hardhome, defeated. As they return to the Wall, they are let in by Ser Alliser Thorne, who disapproves of his drastic action of joining forces with the wildlings. Shortly after, Jon sends Sam and Gilly to safety in Oldtown, approving of their relationship and Sam's motives of keeping her safe. He is later approached by Davos asking for men, and later Melisandre, whose silence confirms Stannis's defeat. That evening, Jon is met by Olly who claims that a range has arrived with knowledge of Jon's uncle Benjen. However, Jon discovers that he has been fooled and a group of mutineers, led by Ser Alliser Thorne, stab Jon repeatedly, with Olly dealing the final blow, leaving him to die in the snow. In season 6, Jon's body is discovered and protected by Davos and his loyal brothers. After the mutineers are dealt with, Jon is resurrected by Melisandre and has the mutineers executed before resigning from the Night's Watch. Shortly afterwards, he is reunited with Sansa, who fled for the Wall to escape from Ramsay Bolton. Though initially reluctant, Jon decides to take Winterfell back from Ramsay after Ramsay sends him a threatening letter demanding Sansa's return on threat of murdering Rickon. Securing help from several Northern houses, Jon attacks Winterfell and manages to overcome the Bolton army thanks to the Knights of the Vale, though Rickon is killed in the process. Jon breaches Winterfell and almost kills Ramsay, but takes him prisoner and leaves Sansa to finish him. In the aftermath, Jon is named the new King in the North by the Northern Lords. In season 7 Jon refuses to be as ruthless as Sansa and other lords expect, letting the children of the treacherous Northern Lords who had fought for the Boltons keep their ancestral homes. Believing that the North is not strong enough to stand alone against the White Walkers and their army, he goes to Dragonstone to persuade Daenerys Targaryen to help. She is hospitable and interested in an alliance but his refusal to bend the knee to her as a condition of the alliance is a sticking point. Jon meets Theon and wants to kill him but restrains himself because Theon had eventually helped Sansa to escape the Boltons. Later Jon appears to forgive Theon, telling the conflicted Theon that he can be both Greyjoy and Stark. Jon decides that the only way to convince Daenerys and the other houses of Westeros of the White Walker threat is to capture a wight and display it in the south. He takes a group of comrades north of the Wall and they capture a wight but are surrounded by an army too large to fight. Jon orders a raven to be sent and they wait on an island while thousands of wights line the shore waiting for the water to freeze. Daenerys arrives and most of the party climb on her dragon and are saved, but they are forced to leave while Jon is still fighting. Expecting to die, he is saved by the arrival of his uncle Benjen who sacrifices himself to send Jon to safety. Jon wakes on Daenerys' ship, and tells her he will bend the knee. They make love. Meanwhile at Winterfell Sam and Bran share pieces of information until they both realise that Jon is the legitimate son of Rhaegar Targaryen and his willing bride Lyanna Stark, and that this makes him the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Sansa Stark</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Sophie_Turner" title="Sophie Turner">Sophie Turner</a>. Sansa Stark of House Stark is the first daughter and second child of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. She was also the future bride of Prince Joffrey, and thus the future Queen of the Seven Kingdoms as well. Her <a href="/wiki/Direwolf_(fictional_creature)" class="mw-redirect" title="Direwolf (fictional creature)">direwolf</a> is called Lady, she is the smallest of the pack. Sansa is naive and wants to live the life of a fairy tale princess and is unwilling to see the harsh realities of the kingdom's politics and rivalries. Her fantasy begins to shatter when Lady is killed, and the situation continues to worsen when her father is arrested for treason. She becomes a hostage to the Lannisters in order for them to have a legitimate claim for the North. Her naïveté is finally shattered when King Joffrey executes her father despite promising her that he would spare him. Sansa is forced to put up an act or endure Joffrey's cruelty. Throughout Season 2, she suffers under Joffrey's abuse until Tyrion puts a stop to it. By the Season 2 finale, Joffrey breaks his engagement with Sansa to marry Margaery Tyrell. However, she is still a hostage; but Petyr Baelish promises to help her return to Winterfell. In Season 3, she is married to Tyrion to secure the Lannisters the North should Robb Stark die. The marriage is unhappy and yet to be consummated, and after Robb's death – upon which Joffrey insists to be given his head to present to Sansa, a request coldly ignored by his grandfather – she is unable to speak to him. In Season 4, Sansa has been mourning her family for weeks and is starving herself in depression. She attends Joffrey's wedding with Tyrion and witnesses Joffrey's death. Dontos Hollard immediately spirits her away from the wedding, moments ahead of Cersei's orders to have her and Tyrion arrested. Dontos brings Sansa to a ship concealed in fog, and she is greeted by Petyr Baelish. Under the guise of making payment, Petyr has the fool killed by his archers, with Petyr explaining that killing Dontos was the only way to ensure his silence – her disappearance when Joffrey died, the execution of her father, deaths of her family and years of torment at the king's hand, will all be considerable motive for Sansa helping Tyrion murder Joffrey. Currently, a thousand of the City Watch are searching for her, Cersei thirsts for vengeance, and Tyrion himself stands trial. Sansa is assured she has finally escaped King's Landing and is safe with Lord Baelish, who takes her to her Aunt Lysa for shelter. Lysa takes Sansa in warmly and has her betrothed to her son, Robin. However, Sansa realises the worst is far from over when Lysa, who is smitten with Petyr, accuses Sansa of trying to seduce him, and she discovers that Robin is a spoiled and rude child, slapping him at one point. When Petyr unexpectedly kisses Sansa, Lysa becomes enraged and nearly pushes Sansa through the castle's Moon Door, but Petyr intervenes by pacifying Lysa and then pushing her through the Moon Door to her death before Sansa's eyes, making Sansa realise that Petyr may have romantic or lustful feelings for her. Sansa speaks up for Petyr when he is questioned about his involvement in Lysa's death, but Sansa reaffirms Petyr's claim that Lysa killed herself due to her own instability and insecurities. Afterward she told Petyr that her reason to protect him in the hearing was because she knew he was the only person she could count on to protect her, demonstrated by his initiative in getting her out of King's Landing while everyone else in power there only wanted to use her as a pawn. In Season 5, she and Petyr leave the Eyrie for a place Petyr promises where Cersei will never find her. At an In, Brienne of Tarth materializes unexpectedly and declares herself for Sansa. Petyr doubts that Sansa would want a sworn shield who let both of her previous masters die, even when Brienne reveals the true, somewhat unbelievable circumstances of Renly's death. Sansa seems inclined to agree, pointing out that Brienne was present at Joffrey's wedding, to which the warrior replies that neither of them wanted to be there. Sansa rejects Brienne's offer of service and watches as she handily defeats the guards and escapes. Petyr tells her that he has arranged for her to be married to Ramsay Bolton, the son of Lord Roose Bolton. This will put her back in Winterfell, which the Boltons now occupy as a reward for their role in the deaths of Robb and Catelyn. Though Ramsay initially seems interested in Sansa, his psychopathic nature quickly shows through, and Sansa is disgusted. She is also antagonized by Myranda, the kennelmaster's daughter, who is in a sexual relationship with Ramsay. Myranda frequently makes veiled threats to Sansa, and shows her what has become of Theon Greyjoy, who was Eddard Stark's ward and whom she grew up with. Sansa is horrified to find that after Ramsay emasculated him, he has taken on a submissive, sullen persona called Reek. After Sansa and Ramsay are wed, he brutally rapes her while forcing Reek to watch. Later, Sansa attempts to talk to Reek, who is unresponsive to her attempts to make him act like his old self by repeatedly calling him Theon instead of Reek. At one point, Reek mistakenly lets slip that her younger brothers, Bran and Rickon, are alive, when she had assumed that they were dead. This realization gives Sansa hope in the midst of her unfortunate situation. As Stannis Baratheon's army sneaks up on Winterfell and is greeted by the bulk of the Bolton forces, Sansa manages to escape her chamber but is stopped by Myranda, who threatens her with a bow. Reminding Sansa that she has nothing left to live for in Ramsay's custody, she is unexpectedly saved by Reek, who breaks his spell of subjugation by throwing Myranda over the bannister. The Bolton's return to Winterfell and, knowing the dire consequences Ramsay would have in place for the both of them when he finds Myranda's body, the couple flee to the wall in terror, where they make the jump off the ledge. In season 6, Sansa makes it to the Wall with help from Brienne and Podrick and reunites with Jon, while Theon returns home. After Jon receives a threatening letter from Ramsay demanding Sansa back, Sansa and Jon decide to fight back against Ramsay and retake the North. Sansa briefly meets with Petyr Baelish, but turns him down for his role in handing her to the Boltons. Realizing that with their meager forces they are still outnumbered, Sansa writes to Baelish for help and he arrives in time with the Vale Knights to smash the Bolton army and help Jon secure victory. After Ramsay is killed, Baelish admits to Sansa that he wants her to rule alongside him as his Queen, but Sansa turns him down. When Jon is named the new King in the North, Sansa notices Baelish glaring at her. In Season 7 Sansa finds some of Jon's decisions infuriating but remains loyal to him. She maintains her support of Jon even when he leaves Winterfell against her advice and the Northern Lords' objections, and even when some of them hint that they're ready to drop their support of Jon and name her their ruler. Sansa is overjoyed to see Arya and Bran return to Winterfell, though she is unnerved by how much they have changed: Bran's loss of humanity and Arya's ruthlessness. Petyr Baelish sees Arya as a threat to his influence with Sansa and attempts to drive a wedge between the sisters. He appears at first to be succeeding but at some point the three Starks realise what Baelish is doing. Sansa pretends to believe Baelish as he insinuates that Arya is plotting her murder. Then to his surprise she accuses him of various crimes in front of the Northern Lords, before finding him guilty and allowing Arya to execute him.</p>

<p><b>Arya Stark</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Maisie_Williams" title="Maisie Williams">Maisie Williams</a>. Arya Stark of House Stark is the younger daughter and third child of Lord Eddard and Catelyn Stark of Winterfell. Ever the <a href="/wiki/Tomboy" title="Tomboy">tomboy</a>, Arya would rather be training to use weapons than sewing with a needle. Her <a href="/wiki/Direwolf_(fictional_creature)" class="mw-redirect" title="Direwolf (fictional creature)">direwolf</a> is called Nymeria. When Ned is arrested for treason, her "dancing master" Syrio Forel helps her escape the Lannisters. She is later disguised as an orphan boy by Yoren, a Night's Watch recruiter, in hopes of getting her back to Winterfell. From then on, she takes the name Arry. During Season 2, Yoren's convoy is attacked by the Lannisters who are under orders by King Joffrey to find and kill Robert's bastard children. Before she is captured, she releases the prisoner Jaqen H'ghar and two others, saving their lives. She and the rest of the captured recruits are sent to Harrenhal under Gregor Clegane who cruelly tortures and kills prisoners everyday. At the same time, she follows the advice of the late Yoren and makes a list of those she wants dead like a prayer. When Tywin Lannister arrives at Harrenhal, he orders the killing of prisoners stopped and makes Arya his cup bearer after figuring out she is a girl. Tywin forms an unlikely friendship with Arya due to her intelligence while remaining unaware of her true identity. Arya reunites with Jaqen who offers to kill three lives in exchange for the three lives she saved. The first two she picks, the Tickler, Harrenhal's torturer and Ser Amory Lorch, after he catches Arya reading one of Tywin's war plans and tries to inform Tywin. After she fails to find Jaqen to kill Tywin, after he heads out to face Robb's forces, she forces Jaqen to help her, Gendry and Hot Pie escape Harrenhal after choosing Jaqen as her third name, for which she promises to "unname" him if he helps them. After successfully escaping, Jaqen gives her an iron coin and tells her to give it to any Braavosi and say "Valar morghulis" if she ever needs to find him. Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie head north for Riverrun and Arya's mother Lady Stark, but are captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners and taken to the Inn at the Crossroads. There, Arya is horrified to be reunited with the vile Sandor Clegane, one of the Brotherhood's prisoners. Arya and Gendry travel with the Brotherhood to meet their leader, now friends with them as they know Arya is Ned Stark's daughter. She escapes them after the Brotherhood acquits Sandor Clegane of murder after a trial by combat and selling Gendry to Melisandre to be sacrificed. Captured by Sandor, she is taken to the Twins to be ransomed to her brother, only to see his wolf and forces slaughtered and her brother paraded headless on a horse. Sandor knocks her unconscious and saves her from the ensuing slaughter, and she subsequently kills her first man when falling upon a party of Freys, boasting of how they mutilated her brother's corpse. In season 4, Sandor decides to ransom her to her Aunt Lysa Arryn in the Vale. With Sandor's help, Arya later retrieves her sword, Needle (a gift from Jon Snow), and kills the sadistic soldier Polliver, who stole it from her. Along the way, Arya slowly begins to bond with Sandor, helping to heal one of his wounds when they are attacked. They eventually arrive at the Vale, but are told that Lysa Arryn killed herself three days prior. Arya laughs with disbelief. Later, Arya and Sandor are found by Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne. Arya refuses to leave with Brienne, assuming her to be an agent of the Lannisters. In the ensuing fight between Brienne and Sandor, Sandor is wounded and begs Arya to kill him, but she just steals his silver and leaves him to die. She then manages to catch a boat to Braavos, befriending the Braavosi captain by showing him the coin Jaqen gave her outside Harrenhal. In Season 5 Arya arrives in Braavos, and the ship's captain, Ternesio takes her to the House of Black and White. She is turned away by the doorman, even after showing the iron coin given to her by Jaqen H'ghar. After spending the night sitting in front of the House, she throws the coin into the water and leaves. Later, after killing a pigeon, Arya is confronted by a group of thieves in the street. Arya prepares to fight them, but the thieves flee when the doorman appears. He walks her back to the House of Black and White, and gives her the iron coin. He then changes his face to Jaqen, and informs Arya that she must become no one before taking her inside the House. Arya's training progresses, during which she gets better and better at lying about her identity. Jaqen eventually gives her her first new identity, as Lana, a girl who sells oysters on the streets of Braavos. She eventually encounters Meryn Trant, who she tortures and executes in retaliation for Syrio's death, revealing her identity and motive in the process. When she returns to the House of Black and White she is confronted by Jaqen H'ghar and the Waif, who tell her that Meryn's life was not hers to take and that a debt must be paid. Arya screams as she begins to lose her eyesight. In season 6, she briefly lives as a beggar in the streets of Braavos, regularly beaten and abused by the Waif, until Jaqen has her trained without her sight and ultimately returns her sight to her. Arya is tasked with assassinating an actress, Lady Crane, but becomes reluctant when she discovers Crane is a decent person and the one who wants her dead is a jealous, less-talented actress. She ultimately botches the assassination and is almost killed by the Waif in retaliation, but seeks shelter with Crane to recover. The Waif tracks her down and a chase ensues throughout Braavos until Arya lures her to her hideout and kills her. She adds the Waif's face to the Hall of Faces, impressing Jaqen, but Arya ends her training with the Faceless Men and returns to Westeros, where she resumes her vengeance by murdering Walder Frey. At the start of season 7 we see Walder Frey hosting a feast for every male Frey and asking them to drink a toast. As they start to choke, he tells them it was a mistake to leave any Starks alive, and as they die of poison Walder reveals to the servants and wives present that he is really Arya Stark. Arya heads for King's Landing to kill Cersei, but on learning that Jon Snow has retaken Winterfell she turns around and heads north. She and Sansa have a happy but awkward reunion. Arya is also reacquainted with Brienne, who she insists spar with her. Brienne is surprised by Arya's skill and needs to raise her effort in order to match Arya, but Arya still scores victories in the brief fight. When Sansa refuses the suggestion of some of the Northern Lords' that she should be the ruler of the North and not Jon she disagrees with them but does not punish them. Arya is angry, saying to Sansa that she should have executed them for treason. Arya is suspicious of Petyr Baelish and spies on him hiding a message, unaware perhaps that he hid it while he knew she was watching. The message is years old, written to Robb by Sansa when she thought she could save her father by obeying Cersei, but Arya tells Sansa it is a betrayal. Sansa finds Arya's bag of faces and is shocked. At some point, the girls realise that Baelish is playing them against each other. With Baelish lulled into thinking his plan is working well, Sansa publicly accuses him of murder and treason. Arya waits for the guilty verdict and executes him.</p>

<p><b>Robb Stark</b> (season 1–3) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Richard_Madden" title="Richard Madden">Richard Madden</a>. Robb Stark of House Stark is the eldest son of Eddard and Catelyn Stark and the heir to Winterfell. His <a href="/wiki/Dire_wolf" title="Dire wolf">dire wolf</a> is called Grey Wind. Robb becomes involved in the war against the Lannisters after his father, Ned Stark, is arrested for treason. Robb summons his bannermen for war against House Lannister and marches to the Riverlands. Eventually, crossing the river at the Twins becomes strategically necessary. To win permission to cross, Robb agrees to marry a daughter of Walder Frey, Lord of the Twins. Robb leads the war effort against the Lannisters and successfully captures Jaime. After Ned is executed, the North and the Riverlands declare their independence from the Seven Kingdoms and proclaim Robb as their new King, "The King in The North". He wins a succession of battles in Season 2, earning him the nickname the Young Wolf. However, he feels that he botched the political aspects of war. He sends Theon to the Iron Islands hoping that he can broker an alliance with Balon Greyjoy, Theon's father. In exchange for Greyjoy support, Robb as King in the North will recognize the Iron Islands' independence. He also sends his mother Catelyn to deal with Stannis Baratheon and Renly Baratheon, both of whom are fighting to be the rightful king. Theon and Catelyn fail in their missions, and Balon launches an invasion of the North. Robb falls in love with Talisa Maegyr, a healer from Volantis due to her kindness and spirit. Despite his mother's protest, Robb breaks his engagement with the Freys and marries Talisa in the 2nd-season finale. On news of his grandfather, Lord Hoster Tully's, death, Robb and his party travel north to Riverrun for the funeral, where the young king is reunited with his great-uncle, Ser Brynden "Blackfish" Tully, and his uncle, Edmure Tully, the new lord of Riverrun. While at Riverrun, Robb makes the decision to execute Lord Rickard Karstark for the murders of two teenage squires related to the Lannisters, a decision that loses the support of the Karstarks and leads Robb to make the ultimately fatal decision to ask the Freys for their alliance. He is killed in the Red Wedding Massacre, after witnessing the murder of his pregnant wife and their child. Lord Bolton personally executes Robb, stabbing him through the heart while taunting that "the Lannisters send their regards", in fact a promise made to Jaime (who had no knowledge of Bolton's impending treason) when leaving for the Twins. His corpse is later decapitated and Grey Wind's head is sewn on and paraded around as the Stark forces are slaughtered by the Freys and the Boltons.</p>

<p><b>Theon Greyjoy</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Alfie_Allen" title="Alfie Allen">Alfie Allen</a>. Theon Greyjoy of House Greyjoy is the youngest son of Lord Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands. He is the hostage and ward of Lord Eddard Stark, stemming from the failed Greyjoy Rebellion. Despite his position, he remains loyal to Eddard and is good friends with his sons Robb and Jon. While he has never questioned his position, he soon begins to have doubts after Tyrion tells him he is nothing more than a servant to the Starks and not everyone respects him. Nevertheless, Theon initially remains loyal to Robb after he goes to war with the Lannisters and supports his decision to have the North secede from the Seven Kingdoms and form their own kingdom. He is sent to the Iron Islands in Season 2 to seek a Stark alliance with the Greyjoys. However, his father criticizes Theon for accepting the northern lifestyle and rejects Robb's proposal. Wishing to prove to his father that he is a true Ironborn, he joins his family's invasion of the North. To gain the respect of his men, he ignores his orders to raid the shores and captures Winterfell. The situation worsens for Theon when he is forced to kill his old mentor Ser Rodrik Cassel and fakes the deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark to the people of Winterfell after they escape by killing two orphans. Regretting what he has done and with no help coming from his family, Theon decides to die fighting with his men defending Winterfell from a Stark force led by Roose Bolton's bastard son. However, he is betrayed by his men due to Robb's offer of clemency and safe return to the Iron Islands if they give up Theon. Theon is taken captive and kept in an unknown castle, where he is briefly tortured, but later manages to escape with the help of a serving boy who claims to works for his sister Yara. He is brought back to the very castle he escaped from, the serving boy proving to actually be his captor and torturer, Ramsay Snow, Lord Bolton's sadistic bastard. Theon is subsequently brutally tortured, flayed and eventually emasculated by Ramsay, who forces him to rename himself Reek, and beats him until he submits to his new name (before his emasculation he told Ramsay that he regretted betraying Robb and calls Ned Stark his "real father"). Theon's penis is sent in a box to his father, with Ramsay threatening to mutilate Theon further unless the Ironmen retreat from the North, which Balon refuses. He states that as Theon defied him by attacking Winterfell, claiming him a "fool" and "not a man anymore", to which Yara responds she intends to save her brother of her own accord. In season 4, Theon has been freed from his restraints by Ramsay, but is forced to work for him as a servant and answer to the name Reek. Roose Bolton later orders Ramsay to launch an attack on Moat Cailin, an Ironborn-occupied fortress that is preventing him from entering the Northern lands, and to take Theon with him. Before they leave, however, the Dreadfort is attacked by Yara and a group of men, but Theon refuses to flee with her, believing it may be another trick on Ramsay's part, forcing Yara to leave without him. As a reward, Ramsay gives Theon a bath and asks for his help in taking Moat Cailin. Theon masquerades as himself and tricks the Ironborn into opening Moat Cailin, leading to them all being flayed by the Bolton army, and subsequently accompanies the Boltons to Winterfell. In Winterfell, he rekindles his relationship with Sansa, who is to be married to Ramsay. On their wedding night Sansa is raped by Ramsay, who forces Theon to watch. Sansa tries to get Theon to save her from Ramsay, but he refuses and eventually admits that he did not kill her brothers. As the Baratheon army arrives at Winterfell to fight the Boltons, he helps her escape by killing Ramsay's sadistic lover, Myranda, as she threatens Sansa with a bow. The couple climb the crest of the wall, and jump. In season 6, after they are reunited with Brienne and Podrick, Theon returns to the Iron Islands, where he discovers that his father has been killed. He endorses Yara to succeed their father, but are usurped by their uncle, Euron, the one responsible for murdering Balon. Theon and Yara flee the Iron Islands for Meereen, offering their support to Daenerys Targaryen in return for her aiding them in overthrowing Euron. In season 7 Daenerys sends Yara's fleet, with Theon and the Sand Snakes, to invade Westeros, but the fleet is set upon with fire by Euron Greyjoy. Euron boards Yara's ship and captures her as Theon watches. He taunts Theon and challenges him to rescue Yara, but Theon jumps into the sea instead. Theon is found by some Iron Islanders, supporters of Yara who are disgusted with Theon for running away when his sister was taken. He returns to Dragonstone and meets Jon, who is furious at Theon's many betrayals and only lets him live because of his eventual help for Sansa. Later Theon tells Jon how hard it was to be torn between his Greyjoy and his Stark allegiances. Jon, softening to Theon, tells him he is both Stark and Greyjoy. Theon meets Euron at the parley in the Dragonpit, an Euron taunts him that he still has Yara. When the few remaining Iron Islanders on Dragonstone announce they are planning on sailing off to be independent pirates, Theon urges them to help him to free Yara instead. Their leader is contemptuous and beats Theon, but Theon refuses to stay down, fights, and eventually prevails. The Iron Islanders, a dozen or so men, agree to help Theon rescue Yara.</p>

<p><b>Bran Stark</b> (season 1–4, 6–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Hempstead_Wright" title="Isaac Hempstead Wright">Isaac Hempstead Wright</a>. Brandon "Bran" Stark of House Stark is the second son and fourth child of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. He was named after his deceased uncle, Brandon. His <a href="/wiki/Dire_wolf" title="Dire wolf">dire wolf</a> is called Summer. During the King's visit to Winterfell, he accidentally came across Cersei and Jaime Lannister engaging in sex, following which Bran is shoved from the window by Jaime, permanently crippling his legs. An <a href="/wiki/Assassination" title="Assassination">assassin</a> tries to kill Bran, but Summer, the direwolf companion, kills the assassin. Bran, when he awakens, finds that he is crippled from the waist down, forced to be carried everywhere by Hodor, and he cannot remember the events immediately before his fall. Slowly, he realizes that he has gained the ability to assume Summer's consciousness, making him a <a href="/wiki/Warg" title="Warg">warg</a> or a skinchanger. After his older brother, Robb, is crowned King in the North, Bran becomes Robb's heir and the Lord of Winterfell. After Theon Greyjoy captures Winterfell, Bran goes into hiding. To cement his claim on Winterfell, Theon kills two orphan boys and tells the people of Winterfell that Bran, and his younger brother <a href="/wiki/Rickon_Stark" title="Rickon Stark">Rickon Stark</a>, are dead. After Theon's men betray him and Winterfell is sacked, Bran, Rickon, Hodor, Osha and their direwolves head north to find his older brother Jon Snow for safety. They ultimately stumble upon Jojen and Meera Reed, two siblings who aid them in their quest. After coming close to the wall, Osha departs with Rickon for Last Hearth while Bran insists on following his visions beyond the Wall. He also encounters Sam and Gilly, who tries to persuade him not to, but Bran claims it is his destiny and leaves through the gate with Hodor and the Reeds. Along the way, Bran and the others stumble across Craster's Keep, where they are captured and held hostage by the Night's Watch mutineers led by Karl. Night's Watch rangers led by Jon eventually attack Craster's Keep to kill the mutineers, but Locke, a new recruit but secretly a spy for Roose Bolton, attempts to take Bran away and kill him elsewhere. Bran wargs into Hodor and kills Locke by snapping his neck, but Bran and his group are forced to continue on their journey without alerting Jon, whom Jojen claims would stop them. They eventually reach the three-eyed raven in a cave, who claims he cannot restore Bran's legs, but will make him fly instead. In season 6, Bran experiences several visions, such as the origins of the White Walkers, the origin of Hodor, and the truth behind the parentage of Jon Snow. After an attack by the White Walkers which results in the deaths of the Three-eyed raven and Hodor, Bran and Meera escape and are rescued by Bran's undead uncle, Benjen, who takes them back to the Wall. He later sees a vision of Jon Snow's birth, learning that he is actually the child of Lyanna Stark. In season 7 Bran appears to have lost much of his personality. He arrives back at Winterfell. Meera says she must leave and is upset by Bran's cold reaction. Sansa is glad to see Bran but is unnerved by his assertion that he is now the Three Eyed Raven. He spends most of his time in the Winterfell Godswood by the Heart Tree. He meets Petyr Baelish and looks into Baelish's past. He testifies when Sansa puts Baelish on trial that Baelish betrayed Ned and sent the assassin to kill Bran. Sam Tarly arrives at Winterfell, and Bran tells Sam that Jon is Jon Sand, having been born to Lyanna Stark in Dorne. Sam replies that the High Septon had secretly married Lyanna to Rhaegar Targaryen, and asks Bran if he can confirm it. Bran directs his visions to Lyanna and Rhaegar's wedding and confirms that Jon Snow was named Aegon Targaryen and is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.</p>

<p><b>Joffrey Baratheon</b> (season 1–4) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Jack_Gleeson" title="Jack Gleeson">Jack Gleeson</a>. Joffrey Baratheon of House Baratheon is the <a href="/wiki/Crown_prince" title="Crown prince">Crown Prince</a> of the Seven Kingdoms. He is the eldest of Cersei Lannister's children and heir to the Iron Throne. Vicious and cruel, he has a short temper and believes he can do anything he wants. He is also a coward when confronted by those who aren't afraid of him. Joffrey is also unaware that King Robert is not his real father – who, in reality, is Jaime Lannister. After Robert's death, the Lannisters make Joffrey the King against his father's will, and Joffrey becomes a cruel ruler and a Puppet King used by his mother. Joffrey makes a mistake when, against Cersei's and Sansa's wishes, he refuses to honor his promise of sparing Ned; instead, Joffrey has him executed. His act worsens the situation with the Lannisters' war effort as Jaime is captured by the Starks and his uncles Renly and Stannis have challenged his claim to the Iron Throne. He frequently orders his Kingsguard to beat Sansa. His cruelty and ignorance of the commoners' suffering makes him unpopular after he orders the City Watch to kill all of his father's bastard children in King's Landing which would later lead to a riot where he is almost killed. When Stannis attacks King's Landing, Joffrey serves only as a figurehead and avoids the heavy fighting. When the battle eventually turns in Stannis' favor, Cersei calls her son into the safety of the castle, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his grandfather Tywin and the forces of House Tyrell. To cement the alliance between their families, Joffrey's engagement to Sansa is annulled so he can marry Margaery Tyrell. Upon the end of Season 3, the marriage is yet to take place, and rifts are growing between Joffrey and his uncle and grandfather, who are (in their respective ways) rebutting his cruelty. He also seems to take little interest in his bride, but is amazed and altered by her ways of winning the people's favor, in which he takes part. In Season 4, Joffrey finally marries Margaery, but he dies at the wedding after being poisoned, and his uncle Tyrion is accused and arrested. It is confirmed, however, he was poisoned by Olenna Tyrell, with assistance from Petyr Baelish and Dontos Hollard, as she wanted to protect Margaery from the physical and emotional abuse that Joffrey had very clearly inflicted on Sansa. Olenna later confides to Margaery that she would never have let her marry "that beast". Following Joffrey's funeral, his younger brother and heir, Tommen, is crowned King.</p>

<p><b>Sandor Clegane</b> (season 1–4, 6–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Rory_McCann" title="Rory McCann">Rory McCann</a>. Sandor Clegane, nicknamed "The <a href="/wiki/Hound" title="Hound">Hound</a>," for his savage nature, is the younger brother of Ser Gregor Clegane and a retainer to House Lannister. He is also Joffrey Baratheon's personal bodyguard. The right side of his face was grievously burned when he was only a boy after his brother accused him of stealing one of his toys and pushed Sandor's face into a brazier, leaving the right side of his face hideously scarred, and a lifelong fear of fire. He is taciturn and brutal, but not without compassion. He is protective towards Sansa after she is captured by the Lannisters. After Joffrey becomes King, Sandor is made a member of the Kingsguard. Although he is still faithful to Joffrey, he frequently defends Sansa from Joffrey's attempts to shame and physically abuse her. During the siege on King's Landing, when wildfire is used to destroy Stannis' ships, Sandor succumbs to his fear of fire and abandons the fight, insulting Joffrey as he leaves. Before fleeing the city, he seeks out Sansa and offers to take her along. She refuses but she recognizes that he had been afraid in the battle. Sandor is later captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners, and is reunited with Arya at the Inn of the Kneeling Man. He is acquitted from murdering Mycah in a trial by combat with the leader of the Brotherhood, Beric Dondarrion, and released. Taking Arya Stark prisoner, he travels to the Twins hoping to ransom her, but arrives just as the slaughter of the Starks at <a href="/wiki/The_Red_Wedding" class="mw-redirect" title="The Red Wedding">The Red Wedding</a> begins and rides off with a shocked Arya in tow. When she attacks a pack of Frey soldiers and stabs one of them to death, he intervenes on her behalf and disposes of the rest. Sandor then decides to take Arya to the Vale instead, to ransom her to her Aunt Lysa Arryn. The two kill several Lannister soldiers as he leaves, causing Tywin Lannister to place a bounty on his head. Sandor and Arya are attacked by Lannister soldiers seeking the bounty and Sandor is bitten on the neck, which Arya heals after the attackers are killed. They eventually arrive at the Vale, but are told that Lysa Arryn is dead. They subsequently stay near the Vale, but are found by Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne, who are searching for the Stark girls. Assuming Brienne to be a Lannister agent after the bounty, Sandor refuses to hand Arya over and a fight ensues between him and Brienne. Brienne eventually bites Sandor's ear off and beats him off a cliff. He survives the fall, but is mortally wounded. He is found by Arya, whom he attempts to provoke into killing him, but she just stares blankly and then steals his silver and leaves him to die, screaming for Arya to kill him. Sandor is presumed dead, yet it is revealed in the sixth season that he was rescued by Ray (<a href="/wiki/Ian_McShane" title="Ian McShane">Ian McShane</a>) who takes him to live with his colony of pacifists. After the colony is slaughtered by renegades from the Brotherhood without Banners, Sandor is the sole survivor, and he hunts down the men responsible. He tracks the Brotherhood, but finds the perpetrators being executed by Beric Dondarrion for their actions. After reminiscing over past events, Beric and Thoros persuade Sandor to join them, as they are heading North to aid Jon Snow in the coming battle against the White Walkers. They reach Eastwatch By Sea and are imprisoned by a suspicious Tormund Giantsbane. Jon Snow arrives on a mission to capture a wight and Sandor, with Beric, Thoros and Tormund join him. Sandor then travels with Jon and the wight to King's Landing for the parley in the Dragonpit, and shows the wight to Cersei. There, Sandor has an uneasy but peaceful reacquaintance with Brienne, and a hostile one with his brother Gregor, telling him that one day he (Sandor) will kill Gregor.</p>

<p><b>Tyrion Lannister</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Dinklage" title="Peter Dinklage">Peter Dinklage</a>. Nicknamed "The <a href="/wiki/Imp" title="Imp">Imp</a>" or "Halfman", Tyrion Lannister of House Lannister is the younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister. He is a <a href="/wiki/Dwarfism" title="Dwarfism">dwarf</a>; and his mother died during his birth, for which his father, <a href="/wiki/Tywin_Lannister" title="Tywin Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a>, blames him. While not physically powerful, Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him. In Season Three, Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin, a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for. Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark; however, on the wedding night, Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone, promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to. The death of her brother Robb, in which Tyrion took no part, causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father, who he claims can't distinguish between his interests and his often-praised ideal of devotion to family. Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth, but stayed himself for the sake of duty. In season 4, Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King's Landing for Joffrey's wedding to Margaery Tyrell, though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister, who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin's orders. When Joffrey is fatally poisoned, Tyrion is framed and arrested. Tyrion, however, implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead. At Tyrion's trial, he demands a trial by combat. Tyrion is approached by Oberyn, who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei's champion, Ser Gregor Clegane. When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed, Tyrion is sentenced to death. Jaime, however, frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King's Landing. Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae, who testified against him and is now Tywin's lover. After a brief struggle, Tyrion strangles Shae to death, and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey's crossbow. Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys. They arrive in Pentos, where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne. Tyrion is bound and gagged by Jorah Mormont, who says that he will take him to Daenerys. Daenerys takes them both to her home in the Great Pyramid of Meereen and asks Tyrion why he is here. Tyrion tells her everything, including Varys' plan. He initially counsels her to stay in Meereen, but Daenerys makes it plain to him that her eyes are still on Westeros. Tyrion tells Daenerys how hard it will be to win the love of both the common people and the nobles. He later joins her at the opening celebrations of Daznak's Pit, where Jorah unexpectedly reappears to defeat every other foe on the arena. As the Sons of the Harpy attack, Tyrion manages to survive by fleeing to the midst of the arena, where they are rescued by Drogon, while Daenerys is spirited away on his back. In season 6, Tyrion struggles to maintain peace in Meereen, particularly when the Sons of the Harpy burn the entire Meereenese Navy, stranding them in Slaver's Bay. Following an alliance with Theon and Yara Greyjoy, Tyrion advises Daenerys to break up with Daario so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros. In gratitude for Tyrion's loyalty, Daenerys names him her official Hand, and he accompanies her back to Westeros. In season 7 Tyrion's advice to Daenerys often conflicts with her views, and he has mixed success in directing her actions. He sneaks into King's Landing and meets with Jamie to set up a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys, which eventually happens in the Dragonpit outside the city. At the meeting a captured wight is produced to convince Cersei that the worst threat is from beyond the Wall. When Cersei is not convinced, Tyrion risks execution to meet with his sister to try again to persuade her. He is unexpectedly allowed to leave Cersei's presence alive, and thinks he has secured an agreement from her to help with the fight against the Wight Walkers.</p>

<p><b>Khal Drogo</b> (season 1–2) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Jason_Momoa" title="Jason Momoa">Jason Momoa</a>. Khal Drogo is a <a href="/wiki/Warlord" title="Warlord">warlord</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Dothraki_Sea" class="mw-redirect" title="Dothraki Sea">Dothraki</a> people. He is to marry Daenerys Targaryen, as arranged by her brother Viserys. He is undefeated in battle. Viserys Targaryen conspired with Magister Illyrio to marry Daenerys to Drogo in order to get his support in an invasion of Westeros. Though Daenerys was initially unhappy with the arrangement, Drogo proves to be a sensitive husband and lover despite his fearsome behavior with his men. After a failed poisoning attempt on Daenerys' life, he promises to invade Westeros to reclaim the Seven Kingdoms for the Targaryens, but Viserys's impertinence ultimately causes Drogo to kill him. Drogo maintains his promise for the benefit of his wife, but is wounded by an enemy khal before he could begin the invasion. The wound festers and Drogo becomes so sick that he is unable to ride his horse, a sign of weakness to the Dothraki. Most of his khalasar abandons him, but Daenerys unknowingly sacrifices their unborn child for a spell to revive him. The spell works, but leaves him a brain-dead husk of his former self. Daenerys smothers him out of pity, and the flames of his funeral pyre ultimately hatch her dragon eggs.</p>

<p><b>Tywin Lannister</b> (season 1–5) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Dance" title="Charles Dance">Charles Dance</a>. <a href="/wiki/Lord" title="Lord">Lord</a> of Casterly Rock, Shield of Lannisport and Warden of the West, Tywin of House Lannister is a calculating, ruthless, and controlling man. He is also the former Hand of King Aerys II. He is the father of Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion. After Eddard Stark's arrest, Joffrey names him Hand of the King once more, but after Jaime is taken captive by the Starks, Eddard is unexpectedly executed by Joffrey, and Renly and Stannis Baratheon challenge Joffrey's claim to the throne; Tywin elects to remain in the field commanding his forces until he wins his war, and in the meantime gives the position of Hand of the King to Tyrion. Tywin continues the war through Season 2 at Harrenhal where he criticizes his commanders for losing and underestimating the Stark army led by King Robb Stark. While there, he forms an unlikely friendship with his cup bearer, unaware that she is actually Arya Stark. Originally, he was about to attack Robb's forces while they are distracted by the Greyjoys seizing Winterfell, but changes his mind and helps the defenders of King's Landing drive Stannis Baratheon's forces away. He assumes his position of Hand of the King once again and arranges for Joffrey to marry Margaery Tyrell to secure an alliance between the Lannisters and Tyrells. In the third season, as Hand of the King, he fortifies his position as <i>de facto</i> leader of the Seven Kingdoms, and he successfully defeats Robb Stark, the King in the North, by forging an alliance with the lords Frey and Bolton, who betray and kill Stark and his men. The crown subsequently pardons and rewards them with Riverrun and the North, respectively, though Tywin is criticized by Tyrion for winning the war through such an unscrupulous scheme. He also has to deal with an increasingly belligerent Joffrey, who chides his grandfather as a coward who "hid under Casterly Rock" while Robert Baratheon led the rebellion against Aerys Targaryen, and complicated relations with his children as he forces them into marriage alliances with Sansa Stark and Loras Tyrell, to secure the support of the Tyrells and Lannister dominion in the North (now Sansa's heirdom, as all her brothers are presumed dead). In the fourth season, Tywin is present at the royal wedding where Joffrey dies, and has King's Landing closed off to prevent Sansa from escaping (although she escapes with help from Petyr Baelish and Dontos Hollard). He grooms Joffrey's younger brother, Tommen, to becoming the new King, and appears determined to make sure Tommen becomes a much better King than Joffrey was. The presence of Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne poses a new problem, however, as he resurfaces the Martell–Lannister antagonism over the rape and murder of his sister Elia by Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane during the Robert's Rebellion; Oberyn believes the deed was done on Tywin's order. Tywin denies the allegations and promises Oberyn justice in exchange for Oberyn serving as one of the judges at Tyrion's trial. At the trial, when several supposed witnesses give false statements regarding Tyrion's supposed guilt, Tywin promises Jaime in private that if Tyrion is found guilty and pleads for mercy, he will exile him to the Night's Watch but only if Jaime ceases to be a Kingsguard and takes his place as heir to House Lannister. However, Tyrion loses his composure, lashes out at Tywin and demands a trial by combat, to Tywin's anger. When Tyrion's champion, Oberyn, loses the fight and is killed, Tywin sentences his son to death. Later, when Jamie helps Tyrion escape, Tyrion discovers that Tywin was having an affair with Shae, Tyrion's former lover, who falsely testified against him at his trial. Tywin is ambushed by Tyrion while in a privy, wielding Joffrey's crossbow. Tywin attempts to reason with Tyrion, swearing that he would never have had him executed, but also – upon Tyrion showing regret for Shae's death – taunts him as "afraid of a dead whore". In rage, Tyrion shoots Tywin twice in the chest, killing him. His body is discovered shortly afterwards, and a grand funeral is held in the Sept of Baelor. As revealed by Davos Seaworth, he was 67 years old. Tywin's death heralds instability in the Seven Kingdoms, with the arrival of the Sparrows in the capital, and rivalry rising between Cersei, who aspires to her father's position but lacks many of his statesmanlike qualities, and the Tyrells. The Boltons also lose the potential Lannister military support just when they are faced with Stannis Baratheon planning to take Winterfell on his way to the Iron Throne.</p>

<p><b>Davos Seaworth</b> (season 2–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Liam_Cunningham" title="Liam Cunningham">Liam Cunningham</a>. Ser Davos Seaworth, also known as "The Onion Knight", is a former <a href="/wiki/Smuggling" title="Smuggling">smuggler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Knight" title="Knight">knight</a> in the service of Stannis Baratheon; he serves as one of Stannis's most trusted advisers. In his smuggling days, he was said to handle a ship at night better than anyone. Before the events of the series, he earned his knighthood by smuggling fish and onions to the besieged Stannis Baratheon and his army during Robert Baratheon's rebellion. Before knighting him, Stannis removed the last joints from four fingers on his right hand as punishment for his years of smuggling; believing these joints bought his family a better future, Davos keeps them in a pouch around his neck for luck. In Season 2, he loyally supports Stannis' claim on the throne and his honesty and willingness to voice his unaltered opinion makes him Stannis' most trusted adviser, though Stannis often dislikes what he hears. An agnostic, he doesn't accept the priestess Melisandre and her god R'hllor but does not object to her because Stannis is also a follower of R'hllor. He fights in the Battle of the Blackwater, where his ships are caught in a giant explosion of wild fire. His son Matthos is killed and Davos is thrown out to sea. He is picked up by the pirate Salladhor Saan, who returns him to King Stannis. Upon attacking Melisandre for the loss of his son, he is imprisoned and later condemned to death for releasing Gendry. Stannis had intended to sacrifice the boy to R'hllor and hence regards Davos' actions as treason, but Davos shows him a letter from Maester Aemon from the Night's Watch, detailing the death of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and Samwell Tarly witnessing the growing army of White Walkers. Stannis pardons Davos upon Melisandre's request, as she claims R'hllor calls them to travel to the Wall to help the Night's Watch protect the kingdom from the White Walkers. In season 4, Davos is still at odds with Stannis for releasing Gendry (as Stannis claims that Robb Stark and Joffrey Baratheon are dead thanks to Gendry's blood) and failing to find him a suitable army, but Davos decides to write a letter to the Iron Bank of Braavos so that they may provide them with the currency to purchase an army to aid the Night's Watch against the 100,000 strong wildling army led by Mance Rayder. Despite the Iron Bank's reluctance to back Stannis, Davos manages to convince them and they acquire the loan. Davos then tracks Salladhor Saan to aid them in exchange for gold. He and Stannis arrive at the Wall in time to save Jon Snow from Mance Rayder. In season 5, Davos remains at the Wall with Stannis to help him in his campaign to retake the North from Roose Bolton. Davos is aware that the Night's Watch will choose a new Lord Commander and believes that Ser Alliser Thorne will win. He tries to convince Jon Snow to accept Stannis's offer of legitimization since Thorne will most likely punish Jon for showing Mance Rayder mercy during the execution. Later, Davos departs from the Wall with Stannis, to help him take Winterfell. As the army becomes snowbound, he is returned to the Wall on Stannis' command, sharing a heartfelt moment with Shireen, where he thanks her for learning him to read and promises to be back within days. Arriving at the Wall, he unsuccessfully tries to convince Jon of their cause, when the couple is suddenly joined by a lone Melisandre, whose sullen demeanour is enough to tell Jon and Davos that Stannis and Shireen are dead. In season 6, after Jon is killed in a mutiny, Davos leads Jon's loyal friends against the mutineers led by Alliser Thorne and they achieve victory thanks to the wildlings' help. Davos later persuades Melisandre to attempt to resurrect Jon, which she succeeds in doing, and becomes one of Jon's top lieutenants in his campaign to retake Winterfell from the Boltons, successfully persuading Lyanna Mormont to supply them with men. He takes part in the Battle of the Bastards and survives, but in the process learns that Shireen was actually burned at the stake by Melisandre. He confronts her about it in front of Jon and she admits her role in Shireen's death, and he demands permission from Jon to execute Melisandre, though Jon has her exiled instead. Davos later joins the Northern Lords in proclaiming Jon the new King in the North. In season 7 Davos travels with Jon to Dragonstone. He helps Tyrion Lannister to sneak into King's Landing for a meeting with Jamie Lannister. While in King's Landing he seeks out Gendry and finds him in a smithy, and brings him back to Dragonstone.</p>

<p><b>Samwell Tarly</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/John_Bradley-West" class="mw-redirect" title="John Bradley-West">John Bradley</a>. Samwell Tarly of House Tarly and the Night's Watch is the eldest son and former heir of Lord Randyll Tarly, is a new recruit to the Night's Watch. He was sent to the Wall by his father, who disowned him for his cowardice. He becomes Jon's best friend after Jon conspires with the others in their trainee class to go easy on him. While not a warrior, he is very smart and insightful. He is inducted into the Stewards and assigned to Maester Aemon. He travels beyond the Wall in place of Aemon and falls in love with Gilly, one of Craster's daughter-wives. Later in Season 2, he finds obsidian "Dragon glass." At the end of the season he becomes a witness to the numerous army of White Walkers and Wights marching to the Fist of the First Men. He manages to escape with a few Night's Watch Men including Lord Commander <a href="/wiki/Jeor_Mormont" class="mw-redirect" title="Jeor Mormont">Jeor Mormont</a>, and they make it back to Craster's Keep. Escaping the slaughter of the Nights Watch mutineers – which ended in Lord Mormont's death – Sam is attacked by a White Walker when making a fire but manages to kill it using the Dragonglass. Alongside Gilly, he manages to cross the Wall and return to Castle Black to bring news of Mormont's death and reunite with Jon. In season 4, fearing for Gilly's safety, Sam takes her to work in an inn in Mole's Town, but later regrets his decision, especially after Mole's Town is attacked by wildlings (though he is unaware that Gilly was spared by Ygritte). He reunites with Gilly, however, when she returns to Castle Black unharmed, and he locks her in the food storage for her safety when the wildlings attack, kissing her for the first time. Sam himself participates in the battle, at one point shooting a huge Thenn through the head with a crossbow and holding the dying Pyp in his arms. In the aftermath, he discovers Janos Slynt to have hidden himself in the food storage with Gilly, and is given Jon's sword to look after as Jon leaves Castle Black to hunt down Mance Rayder. He is later present at the burning of the bodies of those who were killed in the battle for The Wall. In season 5, he expresses concern that if Ser Alliser Thorne is elected the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Gilly and the other wildlings will be executed. At Mance Rayder's execution he comforts Gilly as she couldn't bare to watch. Sam is reading a book on previous Lord Commanders while Princess Shireen Baratheon teaches Gilly how to read. He also learns how the young princess survived Greyscale and that Gilly also had sisters who perished from the disease. At the choosing for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Jon Snow reveals Stannis's offer of legitimization to Sam. Jon states that it was always his dream to be Lord of Winterfell, but he reveals that he will decline the king's offer, much to Sam's surprise. When Maester Aemon asks if there are any more candidates wishing to run against Ser Alliser Thorne and Ser Denys Mallister, Sam puts Jon's name forward as a candidate. Janos Slynt mocks Sam by calling him "Slayer" and pointing out his love for Gilly being similar to Jon's love for Ygritte, and Sam retaliates by publicly mocking Slynt for hiding in the pantry with Gilly and her baby during the wildling attack. Sam reminds all of the black brothers present that Jon was Jeor Mormont's personal steward, that he led the force to deal with the mutineers at Craster's Keep, and took command of Castle Black's garrison during the wildling attack when Thorne was wounded. Sam's speech ultimately results in Jon being chosen as the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Events at the wall go on as normal, until the death of Maester Aemon of old age. Sam is present at the maester's death. Shortly afterward, he catches two Night's Watchmen attempting to rape Gilly. He attempts to defend her, but the two harshly beat him, and he is only saved by Jon's direwolf, Ghost. While tending Sam's wounds, Gilly has sex with Sam. He later leaves with her, convincing Jon that he will aid the Watch much more as a trained maester in Oldtown. His self-confessed motive, however, is to spirit Gilly and her baby – now named "Sam" after her lover – away to safety, of which Jon approves. In season 6, Sam and Gilly briefly stop at Horn Hill, where Sam contemplates leaving Gilly and little Sam with his family, but after an uneasy reunion with his father, Sam decides to take Gilly and the baby with him, and steals the House Tarly Valyrian steel sword, Heartsbane, to learn the secrets behind Valyrian steel. He reaches the citadel in the season finale. In season 7 Sam is a skivvy for the Archmaester, collecting chamber pots and rescribing old scrolls. He meets Jorah Mormont, nearly lost to the disease greyscale, and cures him using a painful and risky treatment in defiance of the Archmaester's orders. Sam is frustrated that the Archmaester will not take the White Walker threat seriously. Eventually he helps himself to scrolls he thinks may be important from the library and heads back north with Gilly and little Sam. Gilly finds in a High Septon's diary that Prince Rhaegar annulled his marriage to Ella Martell of Dorne; Sam ignores this at first but by the time he reaches Winterfell and meets Bran he has read for himself that the High Septon went on to marry Rhaegar to Lyanna Stark in secret. Sam and Bran put their information together to conclude that Jon Snow was born legitimate, named Aegon Targaryen, and the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Margaery Tyrell</b> (season 2–6) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Natalie_Dormer" title="Natalie Dormer">Natalie Dormer</a>. Margaery of House Tyrell is the only daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell, and has recently married the late King Robert's brother, Renly Baratheon, as part of House Tyrell’s support for his bid to seize the Iron Throne from King Joffrey. Somewhere in her mid to late twenties, she is surprisingly canny and cunning. She is aware of her husband's homosexual orientation and inclinations towards her brother. Despite her knowledge of this, she actively attempts to become pregnant as to secure the alliance between their families. When Renly is killed, the Tyrells ally with House Lannister and she is planned to marry to King Joffrey. In a departure from her characterization in the novels, where her personal motivations are unclear, Margaery's naked ambition is made obvious. Upon arriving at King's Landing, she offers Sansa to marry her brother Loras, but the plot is thwarted and Sansa is married to Tyrion Lannister to secure the North should Robb Stark die. At the end of Season 3, her marriage to Joffrey is impending, though her influence over him appears to grow, causing friction between her and Queen Regent Cersei. Cersei coldly implies she could have her killed at any time. In season 4, Margaery and Joffrey are married, but Joffrey dies at the wedding after being poisoned. Since Margaery still cannot become queen this way, she is betrothed to Joffrey's younger brother and heir, Tommen, and visits him one night in his chamber to get to know him better. She is among the many people in King's Landing who believe Tyrion Lannister is not responsible for Joffrey's death, and her grandmother, Olenna Tyrell, confirms to her that it was she who orchestrated it, leaving Margaery visibly shocked, until Olenna claims that it was to protect her from Joffrey's abuse (which he had quite clearly inflicted on Sansa while she was betrothed to him). Margaery is later present at Tyrion's trial, where she is visibly uncomfortable at the possibility of Tyrion being punished for the crime her grandmother committed. After Tyrion kills Tywin and escapes, Margaery attends Tywin's funeral. Margaery marries Tommen soon afterward, as Tommen is now the king. The wedding suffers no problems, and Margaery finally becomes a queen. After consummating the marriage with Tommen, Margaery, who has him completely in her thrall, suggests that Tommen send Cersei back to Casterly Rock. Tensions between Cersei and Margaery increase as Cersei confronts her about Tommen. Margaery insults Cersei, angering her. Cersei then has Margaery's brother, Loras, arrested by the extremist religious movement the Sparrows for homosexual activities. At a trial, Margaery testifies that Loras is not guilty. However, when evidence is procured, Loras gets arrested, along with Margaery, as she lied in her testimony. The High Sparrow reveals that she and Loras will face trial, but that they may receive the "mother's mercy" if they were to confess their crimes. Margaery later feigns surrender to protect her family, and joins Tommen in making an alliance with the Faith. On the day of Cersei's trial, however, Margaery is killed in the explosion which destroys the Great Sept of Baelor.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Stannis Baratheon</b> (season 2–5) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Dillane" title="Stephen Dillane">Stephen Dillane</a>. Stannis Baratheon of House Baratheon, <a href="/wiki/Lord" title="Lord">Lord</a> of Dragonstone, is the elder of Robert Baratheon's younger brothers. A brooding, humorless man known for a hard and unyielding sense of justice, he is obsessed with slights real and imagined. With Robert dying, Ned sends him a letter appointing him as the legitimate heir and becomes another challenger for the Iron Throne after his nephew Joffrey becomes King. By Season 2, he has fallen under the influence of Melisandre, a priestess of R'hllor. After Robert's death, Stannis claims himself the true heir to the Iron Throne as Cersei's children are illegitimate and names himself King of the Seven Kingdoms. However, most of the Baratheon bannermen support the claim of the more charismatic Renly. When Renly is mysteriously slain, many of Renly's bannermen immediately swear allegiance to Stannis. He then attacks King's Landing by sailing up the Blackwater Bay. However, due to Tyrion's plan using wild fire and reinforcements by the Lannisters and Tyrell Cavalry, he loses the Battle of Blackwater. Despite this setback, he is convinced to continue fighting by Melisandre, and is further convinced by her magic as she lets him see a vision of a battle in the flames. He acquires one of Robert's bastards, Gendry, from the Brotherhood Without Banners and plans to sacrifice him to further his quest for the Iron Throne. After Davos questions his course of action, Stannis has three leeches drawn with Gendry's blood and throws them into a fire, calling for the death of Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy and Joffrey Baratheon. Upon the news of Robb's death, Davos releases Gendry to prevent him from being burned. Stannis subsequently sentences his Hand to death but is swayed by Melisandre, who encourages him to travel North to aid the Night's Watch against the threat emerging from beyond the Wall. In season 4, Stannis hears of Joffrey's death and chastises Davos again for releasing Gendry and not finding him a suitable army, prompting Davos to write to the Iron Bank of Braavos in Stannis's name to help pay for an army. The Iron Bank very nearly refuses Stannis' request, even subtly belittling him in the process, but Davos manages to convince them that Stannis is easily the only one they can turn to since Tywin Lannister is nearing old age. Stannis and his army arrive at the Wall shortly after the Battle for Castle Black, interrupting a supposed parley between Jon Snow and Mance Rayder. Stannis learns that Jon is Ned Stark's son, and on Jon's advice, he places Mance and his men under arrest. He is later present at the funeral of the Night's Watch brothers who died during the Battle for Castle Black. In season 5, Stannis begins plans to retake the North from Roose Bolton, hoping to recruit Mance's wildling army, if Mance will bend the knee to him. Mance refuses, and Stannis orders him burned at the stake. Although Stannis was not pleased that Jon interfered with Mance's execution, he presents Jon an enticing offer. If Jon bends the knee and swears his loyalty to Stannis, the king will legitimize him as Jon Stark, making him the Lord of Winterfell. Stannis, after receiving a message from Lyanna Mormont, knows that having a Stark on his side is the best chance of rallying the Northerners to his cause. Stannis departs from the Wall soon afterward, on a mission to take Winterfell from the Boltons. However, his party is delayed by a large snowstorm that ravages the North, and Ramsay Bolton and his men sabotage his supplies by burning them. He eventually agrees, most reluctantly, to sacrifice his daughter to the Lord of Light, sending Davos to the Wall to find supplies as he knows he would never approve of this most drastic action. Conferring with his daughter before her sacrifice, he admits that he will hate himself forever, but goes through with the act, witnessing tearfully as his daughter succumbs. The next day, the blizzard has lifted, though half his army, including all the sellswords have mutinied, taking all the horses to join the Boltons. Selyse is found hanged in a woods, having broken and relented the sacrifice of their child in the last minute and taken her own life. Stannis decides to finish the march on Winterfell by foot, where his greatly diminished army is greeted by a massive cavalry force led by Ramsay which defeats him. Fending off remaining Bolton soldiers in a nearby grove, Stannis succumbs by a tree, where he is greeted by Brienne of Tarth, reminding him of his fratricide. Stannis accepts responsibility and tells Brienne to fulfil her duty, and she lifts her sword and swings.</p>

<p><b>Melisandre</b> (season 2–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Carice_van_Houten" title="Carice van Houten">Carice van Houten</a>. Also known as " The Red Woman", a <a href="/wiki/Priest" title="Priest">priestess</a> of R'hllor in service to Stannis Baratheon. Melisandre has prophetic powers that give her partial knowledge of future events. Unlike many other people in Westeros with access to prophecy, Melisandre has absolute faith in her own interpretation. Melisandre believes Stannis is the chosen one who will convert the people of Westeros into followers of R'hllor. She convinces Stannis of this by using various methods, including seduction. Many, most notably Stannis' trusted adviser Davos Seaworth, believe she is leading their king astray. She has magical powers which help her survive Maester Cressen's attempt to kill her with poison. She also gives birth to a shadow demon which is sent to kill Renly Baratheon and tries to convince Stannis to sacrifice Gendry, the bastard son of Robert Baratheon, because he has king's blood, claiming R'hllor will reward the gift with an easier path to the Iron Throne. After Gendry's escape, she intercepts a letter from the Night's Watch, seeing the prophetic "Other" as the force behind the White Walkers' march on the wall, and insists that Stannis takes up the cause of stopping them. She dismisses "this war of five kings" (now actually three) as unimportant and insists that Stannis take the help of Davos Seaworth, despite his betrayal. In season 4, Melisandre accompanies Stannis, Davos and their army to the Wall, narrowly saving Jon Snow from Mance Rayder. At the funeral of the Night's Watch brothers who fell during the Battle for Castle Black, Melisandre exchanges a knowing glance with Jon. In season 5, she remains at the Wall with Stannis and shows interest in Jon. She attempts to seduce Jon, but he refuses to have sex with her. Eventually, she departs from the Wall with Stannis and Davos on their mission to take Winterfell. When a large snowstorm delays them, Melisandre suggests that Stannis sacrifice his daughter Shireen, but Stannis refuses. After a Bolton raiding party kills many of the horses and burns their supplies, he eventually gives in and allows the priestess to burn his only child. Melisandre declares soon after that the blizzard has been lifted, but after half of Stannis' forces desert him, dismayed and disgusted, she rides for the Wall, where she is accosted by Jon and Davos. In season 6, after persuasion by Davos, Melisandre attempts to resurrect Jon, who was killed in a mutiny, and succeeds, restoring her faith in the Lord of Light. She remains at Jon's side through his campaign to retake the North from the Boltons, and witnesses the Bolton banners being lowered to the ground as in one of her visions. However, she is accused of murdering Shireen by Davos. With obvious regret, she admits what she did, but pleads with Jon not to execute her, claiming that she can help in the coming battle against the Night King. Remembering her role in resurrecting him, Jon does not execute Melisandre, but has her exiled from the North. In season 7 she arrives at Dragonstone and urges Daenerys to make an ally of Jon Snow. She tells Varys she is leaving Westeros but that she will return, as it is her destiny to die there.</p>

<p><b>Jeor Mormont</b> (season 1–3) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/James_Cosmo" title="James Cosmo">James Cosmo</a>. Jeor Mormont, the 997th <a href="/wiki/Lord" title="Lord">Lord</a> Commander of the Night's Watch, is the estranged father of Ser Jorah. He gave up his lands to serve the Night's Watch. His son's shaming of their house weighs heavily on him. He personally requests that Jon Snow be made his personal steward, and gives him the Hand-and-a-Half sword (also known as a bastard sword) of their house, Longclaw. He has the pommel reshaped into a wolf's head. To investigate the return of wights, the disappearance of several Rangers, and rumors of a wildling army, Jeor leads an expeditionary force beyond the Wall in Season 2. In Season 3, after returning to Craster's Keep, he is slain by Rast in the ensuing mutiny, but manages to strangle him before succumbing to his wounds. His death ignites Maester Aemon's call for the lords of Westeros to aid the Night's Watch, which convinces Stannis Baratheon the time is ripe to fight the onslaught of the White Walkers. His corpse is apparently desecrated afterwards, as in season 4, Karl Tanner is shown drinking wine from a skull he claims is Jeor's.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Bronn</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Jerome_Flynn" title="Jerome Flynn">Jerome Flynn</a>. Bronn is a sellsword with a sardonic sense of humor. He initially serves under Catelyn Stark and aids her in arresting Tyrion Lannister and taking him to the Vale to stand trial for the murder of Jon Arryn and attempted murder of Bran Stark. During the trial, Bronn realises that Tyrion will most likely be executed by the insane Lysa Arryn despite the impossibility of his guilt, and volunteers to fight for Tyrion when he demands a trial by combat. Bronn defeats Lysa Arryn's champion and becomes Tyrion's companion and protector, accompanying him back to King's Landing. After they arrive, Bronn's service to Tyrion earns him a position as Commander of the City Watch after Janos Slynt is revealed to be accepting bribes from the Lannisters. When Stannis Baratheon attacks the city by sailing up the Blackwater Bay, he shoots a flaming arrow to a ship containing wild fire which destroys half of Stannis' fleet, and kills several of the attackers in defence of the city. However, Bronn is stripped of his position after Tywin Lannister takes his seat as Hand of The King, but is knighted taking the name Ser Bronn of the Blackwater for his service. He subsequently demands more gold for protecting Lord Tyrion and remains his confidante, though discord is increasing between the two. When Tyrion is forced to marry Sansa Stark, Bronn claims he desires her sexually, which Tyrion takes as a grave insult. In Season 4, Tyrion pays him to train Jaime Lannister in fencing with his left hand, as well as get Shae out of King's Landing, which he assures was completed. Bronn later implores Jaime to visit and help Tyrion after he is accused of murdering Joffrey, telling Jaime that Tyrion originally named him as his defender while on trial in the Vale before Bronn volunteered. Bronn is later betrothed to a rich woman by Cersei in order to stop Tyrion from naming him as his champion. Bronn visits Tyrion in his cell to inform him, and tells him that he most likely would not have been prepared to fight Ser Gregor Clegane, Cersei's champion, anyway. He bids Tyrion farewell and they part ways as friends. In Season 5, Bronn is taking a stroll with his betrothed, Lollys Stokeworth, just outside Castle Stokeworth. Lollys talks at length about the upcoming wedding, but Bronn seems uninterested about discussing it. He does comfort Lollys when she talks about her sister Felyse, saying that mean people will always get what they deserve. The two are interrupted when they see Jaime near the castle. Jaime intends to bring Myrcella Baratheon back from Dorne to King's Landing and wants Bronn to help him. He also reveals that Cersei has arranged for Willas Bracken to wed Lollys instead of him, which angers Bronn, as he and Cersei had an agreement. Jaime tells Bronn that he will get a much better girl and a much better castle once they return from Dorne. Bronn and Jaime infiltrate the Water Gardens and find Myrcella with Trystane Martell, but are intercepted by the Sand Snakes, Oberyn Martell's bastard daughters, who seek to kill Myrcella as revenge against Cersei for Oberyn's death. Bronn sustains a cut while fighting Tyene Sand before they are all arrested by the Dornish guard. While in custody, Bronn almost dies from poison due to Tyene's blade being coated in it, though she gives him the antidote. Though he struck Trystane during the struggle, Bronn is ultimately spared and allowed to return to King's Landing with Jaime, after Areo Hotah strikes him across the face in retribution for harming Trystane. In season six, he accompanies Jaime to the Riverlands to retake Riverrun from Brynden Tully for the Freys, and returns to King's Landing afterwards. In season seven he accompanies Jamie to capture Highgarden, reminding Jamie that he is still owed a highborn wife and a castle by the Lannisters. When the baggage train and force of soldiers he and Jamie are travelling with is attacked by Daenerys' Dothraki and dragons he attempts to use a scorpion (giant crossbow) to shoot down Daenerys' dragon. One of his shots wings the dragon but does not kill it, and the scorpion is destroyed by fire. Bronn sees Jamie about to make a suicidal charge at Daenerys and shoves him into the water just as the dragon is about to incinerate him. In King's Landing Bronn leads Jamie down into the lower levels of the Red Keep, ostensibly to practice with swords, before revealing he had been asked by Tyrion to bring Jamie to a meeting. Cersei describes this as treason, but Jamie takes no action against Bronn.</p>

<p><b>Varys</b> (season 1–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Conleth_Hill" title="Conleth Hill">Conleth Hill</a>. Varys, sometimes called The Spider, is a major character in the second, third, fourth and fifth seasons. He initially appeared as a recurring character in the first season and debuted in "Lord Snow". Varys is bald and tends towards fat, due to his castration. Varys is a eunuch and the Master of Whisperers on the king's small council. He is the Master of Whisperers, the King's foremost spymaster and intelligence agent. He holds no inherited title, castle or lands in Westeros, but is called "Lord" as a courtesy due to his position on the council, which traditionally is made up of high lords. He is a skilled manipulator and commands a network of informants across two continents. He often puts on the public persona of being nothing more than a pudgy man well suited to the pleasantries of court life; humble, obsequious, fawning, and a little effeminate. This is simply a facade that Varys has developed, which often leads those who do not know him well to underestimate him as a cheerful and vapid flatterer. In reality he is a cunning and ruthless manipulator of court politics, on-par with Master of Coin Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish, with whom he frequently spars. Unlike Baelish, Varys insists that his goals are to achieve what he honestly feels is best for the realm, though of course, what he and the current king feel is best might be two separate things. Varys was born across the Narrow Sea in Lys. He was born a slave, and as a child he traveled with a troupe of actors all around the different Free Cities until a sorcerer in the city of Myr made an offer Varys' master couldn't refuse. Varys was sold to the sorcerer, who gave him a potion that made him unable to move or speak but didn't dull his perceptions or sense of pain, and emasculated him (cutting off his testes and penis both) to use his sexual organs in a magical ritual, burning them in a brazier. Afterward the sorcerer had no use for Varys and threw him in the streets to die. Instead Varys resolved to live no matter what: begging, stealing, and selling the sexual use of what parts remained to him, doing anything to survive. He also became an excellent thief, but soon learned that stolen information was often a far more valuable commodity than any physical goods, and he worked his way up from the slums of Myr. He became a master spy and information trafficker, and his influence and reputation grew so great that he eventually found himself as a member of the small council in the Seven Kingdoms. His experience at the hands of the sorcerer had also left him with a bitter hatred for magic and its practitioners. Varys's true loyalties remain a mystery, though he claims to serve "the realm", and abhors the suffering and political instability brought by the war. After Littlefinger's confidante Ros is severely beaten by Joffrey's guards and he fails to intervene, Varys takes her into his service as a spy. Littlefinger finds out and has her killed, taunting Varys that he couldn't protect her. Varys affirms his course as a means to prevent chaos befalling the realm, claiming that Littlefinger "would see the Seven Kingdoms burn, if he could be king over the ashes." Varys later informs Tyrion that Cersei has discovered his relationship with Shae. Though he claims he will not lie for him, he implores Tyrion to send Shae away for her own safety. Varys later testifies against Tyrion at his trial for murdering Joffrey, but when Tyrion is convicted, Jaime enlists Varys's help in smuggling Tyrion out of King's Landing to Essos. As Varys prepares to go back, he hears the tolling bells, making him realise that Tyrion's escape has been discovered (along with his murder of Tywin), so he stays on the boat with Tyrion. In Season 5, he and Tyrion arrive in Pentos, where he convinces Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne. Travelling to Volantis, Varys and Tyrion discuss the former's brief tenure as Hand of the King. Tyrion laments not leaving King's Landing with Shae when he had the chance, but tells Varys that he enjoyed serving as Hand. Varys eventually surfaces in Meereen, where he confers with Tyrion about the future of the city and the Seven Kingdoms. In season 6, after helping Tyrion broker an alliance with the slave masters, he departs Meereen to find new friends in Westeros, and secures help from Olenna Tyrell and Ellaria Sand to aid Daenerys. In season 7 he is challenged by Daenerys over having served Robert Baratheon after Robert took her father's throne, and over his role in the attempt on her life in season 1. She pardons him. Varys is told by Mellisandre that both she and he are destined to die in Westeros.</p>

<p><b>Shae</b> (season 1–4) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Sibel_Kekilli" title="Sibel Kekilli">Sibel Kekilli</a>. Shae is a young <a href="/wiki/Sex_worker" title="Sex worker">camp follower</a> in whom Tyrion Lannister takes particular interest. She is from Lorath, one of the Free Cities across the Narrow Sea. Tyrion falls in love with her and in order to hide her from his father, Tyrion appoints Shae to be Sansa's handmaiden. As her handmaiden, Shae is the only person Sansa trusts and confides to her about her problems and what she really thinks about the Lannisters. In turn, Shae becomes protective of Sansa and attempts to help her in any way she can. In Season 3, she becomes jealous of Tyrion after his marriage to Sansa and is confronted by Varys, who urges her to leave the Seven Kingdoms, which she refuses to do, thinking that Tyrion has something to do with Varys talking to her. In Season 4, Tyrion is forced to send Shae away from King's Landing on a ship after her presence is discovered by Cersei and his father is told, insulting her in the process. Shae, however, does not leave King's Landing, and resurfaces at Tyrion's trial for murdering Joffrey, where she falsely claims that both Tyrion and Sansa were responsible for Joffrey's death. It is revealed, however, that Shae was having an affair with Tywin. After Tyrion is freed by Jaime, he finds Shae sleeping in Tywin's bed, making him realise the horrible truth. Shae attempts to kill Tyrion with a knife, but he strangles her to death.</p>

<p><b>Ygritte</b> (season 2–4) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Rose_Leslie" title="Rose Leslie">Rose Leslie</a>. A Wildling girl with red hair ("kissed by fire", a sign of luck among the Wildlings) and a follower of Mance Rayder. In Season 2, she is captured in the Skirling Pass by Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand. She manages to escape, but is recaptured by Jon, separating him from his brothers in the process. Later she leads him into Rattleshirt's ambush. After this they lead Jon to Mance Rayder's wildling camp, where he pretends to defect to the Wildlings to discover their plans. She then travels with him to the wall, and during this journey she seduces him. However, when confronted with killing an innocent horse farmer for the watch who scaled the wall, Jon escapes the wildling's clutches on horseback. But while resting, Ygritte manages to catch up with Jon at which point she confesses her love for him and then, blinded by tears, shoots him multiple times while he escapes towards the wall. In Season 4, Ygritte starts raiding villages south of the wall with her group, clearly thirsting for vengeance against Jon, although Tormund suspects she let him go. When the wildlings attack Mole's Town, Ygritte slaughters all the women present, but notices Gilly hiding with her baby son, and spares her life. When the wildlings finally reach Castle Black and attack, Ygritte kills many Night's Watch brothers with her archery skills, among them Pyp. When confronted by Jon, however, she cannot bring herself to shoot him, and is shot in the back by Olly, a boy whose father Ygritte previously killed. Ygritte subsequently dies in Jon's arms, and her body is later burned by Jon himself, separately from the other soldiers, in her homeland, north of the Wall.</p>

<p><b>Gendry</b> (season 1–3, 7-present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Joe_Dempsie" title="Joe Dempsie">Joe Dempsie</a>. Gendry is an apprentice <a href="/wiki/Blacksmith" title="Blacksmith">blacksmith</a> in King's Landing and an unacknowledged bastard of King Robert. During Season 1, Eddard tells the smith that if Gendry ever shows interest in wielding a sword to send him to Eddard. Gendry shows promise as a smith and makes a helmet in the shape of a bull's head; Eddard compliments the helmet, offering to purchase it. Gendry refuses, to the shame of the master smith. After Eddard Stark's fall and eventual execution, arrangements are made for Yoren of the Night's Watch to take Gendry to the Wall with him; he travels North with Yoren and other recruits, including Arry, Lommy Greenhands, Hot Pie and Jaqen H'ghar. During their journey, they are stopped by the Goldcloaks, who demand that Yoren give up Gendry as King Joffrey wants all of his father's bastards killed but are forced to leave by Yoren. Later, Gendry reveals to Arry that he knows she is a girl disguised as a boy all along and is surprised to learn she is Arya, Ned Stark's daughter. After the Goldcloaks get help from Ser Amory Lorch and his men who kill Yoren, Gendry's life is saved by Arya when she lies to the Goldcloaks that Lommy, who was killed during the attack, was Gendry. Gendry and the rest of recruits are sent to Harrenhal where Ser Gregor Clegane arbitrarily has many of the prisoners tortured and killed. Gendry was about to suffer this fate but is saved by the arrival of Lord Tywin Lannister, who chides Clegane's men for their reckless behavior. Thanks to Jaqen, Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie are able to escape Harrenhal. As they head towards the Riverlands, the group encounters the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of Outlaws that defend the weak. Inspired, he decides to join the Brotherhood but is betrayed by them when they sell him to Lady Melisandre as ordered by the Lord of Light. Melisandre later reveals to Gendry that King Robert was his father and she is bringing him to meet his uncle, King Stannis. But in truth, Melisandre and Stannis planned to use him for her blood magic where Stannis uses his nephew's blood to make a death curse on the usurpers to his throne, Joffrey, Robb, and Balon Greyjoy. Before they can use him as a sacrifice, Davos Seaworth helps Gendry escape and puts him on a boat to King's Landing. Unable to swim or row, Gendry is nevertheless convinced that the Red Woman has a surer death in spare for him, and Davos asks him to "have a bowl'o brown for me" when returning to Flea Bottom. In Season 7 Davos, on a clandestine visit to King's Landing, seeks out Gendry and finds him working as a smith. Gendry needs no persuading to go with Davos to Dragonstone. There he meets Jon Snow and volunteers to go with Jon on a mission north of the Wall to capture a wight. During the mission he is sent back to the Wall to summon help. He gets word to Daenerys, and later leaves with the others on the Targaryen ship.</p>

<p><b>Tormund Giantsbane</b> (season 3–7) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Kristofer_Hivju" title="Kristofer Hivju">Kristofer Hivju</a>. A wildling raider known for his many titles, "Giantsbane" being foremost. Loud and gregarious, he is one of Mance's top generals, fierce and terrible in combat. Tormund takes a liking to Jon after he joins them and even gives him advice over his relationship with Ygritte. Tormund leads a group of wildlings south of the Wall to await the signal of Mance Rayder to attack the Night's Watch. He later leads the attack on Mole's Town. When the army reaches Castle Black, he duels and severely wounds Ser Alliser Thorne, but is brought down by several arrows and taken prisoner for questioning. After his wounds are healed by Maester Aemon, Jon briefly approaches him, and he tells Jon that Ygritte loved him, citing Ygritte's apparent desire to kill him as proof. He is later present at Mance's execution, and is visibly saddened at his friend's death. He is eventually freed by Jon, who he accompanies to Hardhome, where he attempts to convince the local wildlings to join the Night's Watch in the battle against their common enemy. As Hardhome is overrun by wights and white walkers, Tormund ferociously fights them off and escapes to the boats with Jon. He later passes through the Wall and into the Seven Kingdoms along with the rest of the wildlings. In season 6, after hearing of Jon's murder, he rushes back to Castle Black to bring down the ones responsible, and later witnesses Jon's resurrection and execution of the mutineers. From there on, Tormund becomes one of Jon's lieutenants in his campaign to retake the North from Ramsay Bolton. In the ensuing battle, he fights and kills Smalljon Umber, and witnesses Jon defeat Ramsay after Ramsay shoots Wun Wun dead. He is later present when Jon is named the new King in the North. In season 7 Tormund and a group of Free Folk go to Eastwatch at the end of the Wall, expecting the Army of the Dead to approach the Wall at that point. When Jon arrives there on his way north to capture a wight, Tormund volunteers to go along. Tormund is enamoured of Brienne of Tarth and says he hopes to make big monstrous babies with her. Tormund is at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea with Beric Dondarrion when the Night King attacks with Viserion, now resurrected as a wight dragon, or "ice dragon". Following the breaching of the Wall, it is uncertain if Tormund and Beric made it out alive as they were last seen running for their lives.</p>

A young wildling girl who lives north of the Wall, Gilly is one of many daughters of Craster, a wildling who takes all his daughters as wives once they grow up into women. She has a son with her father Craster. Samwell falls for her and becomes protective of her. After Craster is killed and Commander Mormont's rangers turn on each other, Samwell runs with Gilly and her son to Castle Black. Along their journey, Gilly becomes fascinated with Samwell over his knowledge and his bravery of defending her son from a White Walker. After the three of them manage to reach Castle Black, Maester Aemon allows Gilly and her son to stay with them. In gratitude for Samwell helping them, Gilly names her son after Sam. In Season 4, Gilly settles in a nearby inn close to Castle Black, with Sam's assistance. The Inn is later attacked by wildlings, but Gilly hides with her son. They are found by Ygritte, who spares them. They make it back to Castle Black safely, where Sam hides them in the food storage, and kisses Gilly for the first time in case he dies. She is also visibly surprised when Janos Slynt hides in the food storage as well. Gilly remains unharmed throughout the battle, and reunites with Sam in the aftermath. In season 5, she expresses concern of being sent away or executed if Ser Alliser Thorne becomes the new Lord Commander. She is later present at Mance Rayder's execution. Gilly has begun to learn letters from Princess Shireen Baratheon, with Samwell watching over the two. Gilly also reveals to Shireen that she had sisters that also had Greyscale, but they were quarantined away from the other women at Craster's Keep and eventually succumbed to the disease. After Maester Aemon's death, during Jon's absence in Hardhome, she is almost sexually assaulted by two members of the Watch, but is saved by Sam and Ghost, after which she willingly makes love to him. She and her baby later leave Castle Black for Oldtown with Sam on Jon Snow's orders. Along the way, they stop at Horn Hill, where Sam initially intends to leave Gilly and the baby with his family, but despite Randyll Tarly allowing them to stay, Sam decides to take them with him to the Citadel in Oldtown. In the sixth-season finale, they arrive. Later in Oldtown Gilly enthusiastically makes use of her newfound literacy, and in the diaries of a former High Septon she learns that a prince named Rhaegar Targaryen had his marriage annulled in Dorne.

<p><b>Brienne of Tarth</b> (season 2–present) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Gwendoline_Christie" title="Gwendoline Christie">Gwendoline Christie</a>. A former member of Renly Baratheon's Kingsguard. She is a highly trained and skilled warrior made dangerous by the fact that men underestimate her. She is considered ugly because she is abnormally large in height and build, androgynous, and stronger than most men. She wishes to prove her valor in a worthy cause to win respect and acceptance. She becomes infatuated with Renly after he shows her kindness and courtesy, and she wins a place in his Kingsguard after winning a tournament melee against Ser Loras. Renly trusts Brienne because of her loyalty and her willingness to die for him. She is present at Renly's death and is falsely accused of his murder. She flees with Catelyn Stark and enters her service. Later Catelyn decides to release Jaime Lannister in exchange for her daughters Sansa and Arya, Brienne is sent to protect Jaime on the journey and to escort the Stark girls back. On the journey back to King's Landing, both are captured by the violent Roose Bolton, who holds them at Harrenhal. While there, Brienne learns the truth behind Jaime's murder of the Mad King, but is forced to stay behind while Bolton's men accompany Jaime back to King's Landing, although Jaime rescues Brienne from Harrenhal upon learning that Bolton's unruly henchman, Locke, intends to feed her to his bear. Brienne succeeds in getting Jaime home safely. In Season 4, Brienne remains in King's Landing sworn to Jaime, and tensions arise between them again when Jaime refuses to uphold his promise to return Arya and Sansa to Catelyn, on the basis that Catelyn is dead, Arya is missing and Sansa is married to Tyrion. Brienne is later present at Joffrey and Margaery's wedding, where Cersei implies that Brienne has fallen in love with Jaime, an accusation she answers with silence. Brienne is eventually sent on a mission by Jaime to find and protect Sansa. Jaime provides her with Joffrey's sword, which she names "Oathkeeper", new armour and Podrick Payne to serve as her new squire. As she leaves, she almost breaks down in tears, and looks back at Jaime while on her horse, which causes Jaime to realise her feelings for him. On the way, Brienne and Podrick stop at an inn and meet Hot Pie, who tells them that Arya Stark may still be alive. They eventually find Arya and Sandor "The Hound" Clegane near the Vale. Brienne and Arya initially bond over both being women who prefer to fight, but her sword causes Arya and Sandor to believe she may be a Lannister agent after the bounty on Sandor's head. A fight ensues between Brienne and Sandor, in which Sandor injures Brienne, but Brienne manages to bite Sandor's ear off and hit him off a cliff to his apparent death. Arya disappears during the fight, and Brienne and Podrick set out to search for her, though she is visibly distraught that Arya refused her help. Brienne and Podrick stop at an inn. While eating, Podrick sees Sansa and Petyr Baelish eating in the back of the inn, guarded by knights. Brienne orders Podrick to secure more horses, and then moves toward Petyr and Sansa. After Petyr allows her to approach, Brienne pledges her life to Sansa. When Petyr accuses her of Renly Baratheon's murder, Brienne explains that Renly was killed by a shadow with Stannis's face. Sansa tells Brienne that she doesn't want her protection, and asks her to leave. Petyr attempts to have his guards take Brienne into their custody, but she flees with Podrick, stealing a horse and releasing several others. The guards give chase, and Brienne and Podrick are separated. After evading her pursuers, Brienne sees Sansa and Petyr fleeing. She searches for Podrick, and saves him from two of the knights. Podrick suggests that they stop pursuing Sansa as she refused their help, but Brienne is adamant that she will not be safe with Lord Baelish. She follows the couple to Moat Cailin and then to Winterfell, where she watches the high tower from a village outside, with Sansa promised escape if she lights a candle in the highest tower. As Stannis Baratheon's army approaches, Sansa lights the candle and Brienne prepares to get her, only to find Stannis gravely wounded on the battlefield. She asks him for the truth about Renly's death, to which he confesses guilt, and executes him with her sword. Shortly afterwards, she and Podrick rescue Sansa and Theon Greyjoy after they flee Winterfell, and Sansa accepts Brienne into her service. She takes her to Jon Snow at Castle Black, but later heads to the Riverlands to recruit Brynden Tully's help in for Jon and Sansa to retake Winterfell from Ramsay, but is unsuccessful. She also shares an uneasy reunion with Jaime in the process. When Riverrun falls, Brienne escapes with Podrick in a boat. Back at Winterfell in season 7, Brienne meets Arya again. Arya demands that Brienne spar with her, and Brienne soon finds that she cannot easily beat Arya, who manages to point a sword at her throat. Brienne is sent by Sansa to the parley at the Dragonpit, where she meets The Hound, who she thought she had killed..</p>

<p><b>Ramsay Bolton</b> (season 3–6) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Iwan_Rheon" title="Iwan Rheon">Iwan Rheon</a>. The illegitimate son of <a href="/wiki/Roose_Bolton" title="Roose Bolton">Roose Bolton</a>, Ramsay Snow of House Bolton is cruel, sadistic and very cunning. After the Ironborn captures Winterfell, he marches on the castle's token garrison and offers it safe passage for surrender; after the gates are opened, he captures Theon and flays the other defenders. At the Dreadfort, Theon is put through gruesome physical and psychological torture on Ramsay's instigation, though he himself watches in guise of a cleaning boy. He helps Theon Greyjoy escape from captivity, claiming to be a servant of Theon's sister, Yara, and promises to help him reach her, but ends up only leading Theon back to his original place of imprisonment to taunt him further. He tortures Theon by flaying his fingers and forces him to beg to have them cut off. He ultimately emasculates him and has his manhood sent in a box to the Iron Islands to press Balon to evacuate the North, suggesting he could dismember Theon slowly and send him home in boxes if his demands are not met. He forces Theon to become his new servant, who is now called Reek, and beats him until he accepts the name. In Season 4, Ramsay along with his now slave servant, Reek, hunt down a servant girl named Tansy. Ramsay hunts her for sport and in the end feeds her to his dogs (bastards girls). Ramsay has followed his father in pledging loyalty to the Lannisters, and remains Acting Lord of the Dreadfort until Roose and his men arrive (having been smuggled back into the North to avoid the Ironborn). Ramsay warmly greets his father, new stepmother "Fat" Walda Frey, and friend Locke, but he is chastised by his father for torturing Theon, who would have proved a valuable hostage. Roose enlists his son in his plans to reconquer the North from the invading Ironborn – his father assigns Ramsay, "Reek" and what men Ramsay has to capture Moat Cailin from the Ironborn, in exchange for Roose considering legitimizing Ramsay as a full member of his family, a prospect that delights Ramsay. When Yara and some Ironborn killers attack the Dreadfort and attempt to take Theon, Ramsay confronts her in the dungeons and sets the hounds on her, forcing her to flee without Theon, who refused to go with her believing it was another trick of Ramsay's, and too broken and frightened to take the risk. As a reward for Theon's loyalty, Ramsay gives him a bath, bathing Theon himself, and asks for his help in taking Moat Cailin. Ramsay sends Reek into Moat Cailin with a peace banner and a letter promising safe passage to the Stoney Shore. Reek pretends to be his former self, Theon Greyjoy, and convinces the ironborn to surrender. Ramsay breaks his promise and flays the Ironborn living and displays their bodies on stakes. As a reward, Ramsay is legitimized by his father and takes the name, Ramsay Bolton, discarding the surname "Snow" for good, much to Ramsay's delight. Ramsay and the rest of the Bolton forces then march on towards Winterfell, the Boltons' new home. To solidify their claim for legitimacy, he is provided Sansa Stark as a suitable bride, who he promises never to harm before Baelish, but nevertheless brutally rapes her on their wedding night. He later skins a woman alive for attempting to light a candle in the high tower of Winterfell, which would signal to Brienne (waiting in the village outside the walls) that Sansa was in need of rescue. At the battle of Winterfell between Baratheon and Bolton forces, he rides out to greet Stannis, destroying his army and killing most of his men but meanwhile, Reek rebels against his master and kills his lover, Myranda, escaping with Sansa in the process. With his position as Roose's heir in question following Sansa's disappearance and the birth of Roose's baby boy, Ramsay kills Roose, Walda and the baby and becomes the new Lord of Winterfell, securing help from House Karstark and House Umber, the latter giving him Rickon Stark as a hostage. He kills Osha and sends a letter to Jon Snow demanding Sansa's return, but Jon and Sansa decide to challenge Ramsay and retake Winterfell. Ramsay parleys with Jon and refuses his offer to a one-on-one duel. On the day of the battle, Ramsay lures Jon and his men into a trap by murdering Rickon, but his forces are smashed by the Knights of the Vale. Ramsay flees back to Winterfell, where Jon beats him severely and orders him locked up as a prisoner. That night, Ramsay is fed to his own hounds, bringing House Bolton to extinction.</p>

<p><b>Ellaria Sand</b> (season 4–7) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Indira_Varma" title="Indira Varma">Indira Varma</a>. The sexually promiscuous <a href="/wiki/Intimate_relationship" title="Intimate relationship">paramour</a> of Oberyn Martell, she is the mother of the four youngest Sand Snakes. She is later present at Tyrion's trial by combat, where Oberyn fights Gregor Clegane in Tyrion's name, and is horrified when Oberyn is killed. In Season 5 Ellaria arrives at Dorne at the Water Gardens, Ellaria, still in mourning clothes, observes Trystane Martell and Myrcella Baratheon from a distance. She approaches Prince Doran Martell, but her path is initially blocked by Captain Areo Hotah. Ellaria threatens Areo before the captain is ordered by Doran to stand down. Angrily, Ellaria scolds Doran for his apparent inaction at the news of Oberyn's death. Doran plans to bury and mourn his beloved brother, but Ellaria and Oberyn's daughters want the Dornish people to take up arms and avenge their fallen prince. She also voices her contempt for Myrcella and wants to harm her in order to send Cersei Lannister a message. Doran strictly forbids this, stating that under his rule, they will not mutilate little girls for revenge. Ellaria voices doubts that Doran will remain in power if he continues to do nothing and leaves. She meets up with Oberyn's three bastard daughters, the Sand Snakes (Obara, Nymeria, and Tyene), and tells them that they must capture Myrcella and kill her out of revenge for Oberyn's death. However, when the Sand Snakes attempt this, both them and Ellaria are captured by Doran's guard. She pleads for mercy and is forgiven, being explicitly warned by Doran that he "never gives anyone a third chance". She says goodbyes to Myrcella Baratheon, who forgives her and shares an unexpected kiss, concealing a sinister induction of poison into the girl's mouth. Ellaria watches the ship sail and administers the antidote to herself while contemplating what will come when Doran realises what she has done. In Season 6, apparently having made amends with Doran, she strolls with him in the Water Gardens while reminiscing about Oberyn. When the maester brings a letter from Jaime Lannister with the news of Myrcella's death, Doran realizes it was Ellaria's work, but she stabs him to death before he can react. Ellaria taunts a dying Doran for his weak rule and inaction at the deaths of Elia and Oberyn. With his dying breath, Doran begs Ellaria to spare Trystane's life, but she refuses, telling him that both him and his son are weak and weak men will never rule Dorne again before leaving him to die on the floor. Later, Ellaria sends Obara and Nymeria to King's Landing to kill Trystane, bringing the extinction of House Martell and usurping power over Dorne. After hearing of the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei's work which claimed the lives of almost all of House Tyrell, Ellaria invites Olenna Tyrell to Dorne to discuss an alliance against Cersei, and reveals that through Varys, she has declared for Daenerys Targaryen. In Season 7, Ellaria and her daughter Tyene are captured by Euron Greyjoy and brought to Cersei. Taking the Sands to the dungeons, Cersei taunts Ellaria, and kisses Tyene with the same poison used to kill Myrcella. She leaves Ellaria to watch Tyene die, telling Ellaria she will be kept alive until her daughter's body is completely decomposed.</p>

<p><b>Daario Naharis</b> (season 3–6) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Ed_Skrein" title="Ed Skrein">Ed Skrein</a> in season 3, and by <a href="/wiki/Michiel_Huisman" title="Michiel Huisman">Michiel Huisman</a> from season 4 onwards. Daario is a confident and seductive warrior who is a lieutenant in the Second Sons, a group of 2000 <a href="/wiki/Mercenary" title="Mercenary">mercenaries</a>. Daario has an unusual code of honor: he won't sleep with sex workers or kill innocents as he believes in making love with women who want to make love with him and killing those who want to kill him. Under the leadership of his Captain Mero and second in command Prendhal na Ghezn, the Second Sons were hired by the Slaver city Yunkai to fight against Daenerys' army. Smitten with Daenerys, Daario refused to obey his superiors when they decided to assassinate her, which forced him to kill Mero and Prendhal in self-defense. With the Second Sons under his command, Daario and his men pledge their allegiance to Daenerys. In season 4, Daario attempts to romance Daenerys by offering her flowers and lecturing her about the special use of these flowers, as he claims it is important to know the land she is going to rule. At the gate of Meereen, Daario volunteers to fight Meereen's champion in single combat after Daenerys rejects the rest of her inner circle from fighting. Daario declines the use of a horse, noting that they aren't as intelligent as humans. Daario ends the duel with ruthless efficiency, striking down the horse with his stiletto and decapitating the dazed champion with his arakh. Later on after conquering Meereen, Daario sneaks into Daenerys' private chambers and gives her more flowers. As Daenerys initially refuses him, he tells her he only has two talents in his life: war and women, and that in Meereen he serves no purpose. Daario asks her to let him do what he does best, killing her enemies. Instead, Daenerys focuses on the other thing Daario claims to be good at and orders him to take off his clothes. The morning after, Daenerys informs Jorah that she has sent Daario, Hizdahr zo Loraq and the Second Sons to Yunkai in order to bargain with the masters who retaken control of the city. In season 5, Daario returns with Hizdahr zo Loraq, informing Daenerys that the mission was successful, but the masters want Daenerys to reopen the fighting pits in return. Daenerys refuses, and while in bed, Daario attempts to convince her otherwise, claiming that it was his early life in the fighting pits that led him to join the Second Sons and meet Daenerys in the first place. After Barristan Selmy is killed and Grey Worm left near death, Daenerys heeds Daario's advice and reopens the pits, but refuses Daario's advice on publicly executing all the slave masters. Daario is present on the opening day of the fighting games, and banters with Hizdahr and Tyrion Lannister about who will win the competition. He fights to protect Daenerys when the Sons of the Harpy launch another attack and watches her fly away on Drogon. In the aftermath, Daario advises Tyrion, Grey Worm and Missandei to stay in Meereen and hold the city together while he and Jorah depart to search for Daenerys. In season 6, they finally track Daenerys to Vaes Dothrak and witness Daenerys slaughter the khals and become the new ruler of the Dothraki. Daario leads the Dothraki back to Meereen to slaughter the Sons of the Harpy once and for all, but on Tyrion's advice, Daenerys breaks up with Daario and leaves him to govern Slaver's Bay so that she may pursue a marriage alliance in Westeros. Daario reluctantly accepts while proclaiming his love for Daenerys.</p>

She effectively serves as the replacement of Doreah after she betrayed Daenerys in Qarth. She later begins to teach Grey Worm how to speak the common tongue, and they develop romantic feelings for each other, despite Grey Worm being an Unsullied who was castrated at youth. She is visibly saddened when another Unsullied, White Rat, is killed in a brothel by the Sons of the Harpy.

<p><b>"Jaqen H'ghar"</b> (season 2, 5–6) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Wlaschiha" title="Tom Wlaschiha">Tom Wlaschiha</a>. Sly, enigmatic, and a dangerous criminal, Jaqen is part of Yoren’s group of recruits taken from King’s Landing to join the Night’s Watch. A foreigner from Braavos, though he originally claims Lorath, he speaks in third person, referring to himself as "A man". On the journey, he meets Arya Stark. When the group is attacked by Lannister bannermen, Arya frees him and two other prisoners, saving them from a fire. He finds Arya again at Harrenhal, where he has since disguised himself as a Lannister guard. He asks her to name three people for him to kill to repay the three deaths she stole from the Many-Faced God, but he refuses to help her in any other way. She chooses two of her enemies, the Tickler, the torturer of Harrenhal, and Ser Amory Lorch, the man who killed Yoren and tried to expose her to Tywin Lannister, and chooses Jaqen himself as the third. Arya "unnames" him after he agrees to help her escape. After the break-out, he gives Arya an iron coin, instructing her to give it to any Braavosi and say "Valar Morghulis" ("All Men Must Die" in High Valyrian) should she need more help. He then magically changes his appearance, assumes a new identity, and departs. He and Arya are reunited when she arrives at the House of Black and White in Braavos and he begins training her to become a Faceless Man, though the task proves difficult since Arya is still too attached to her past as a Stark. Jaqen later tasks her with assassinating a fraudulent insurance broker, but she reneges on her mission and instead steals one of the masks to murder Meryn Trant, the Kingsguard who killed Syrio Forel, Arya's first mentor. In retribution, Jaqen confronts Arya and condemns her to lose her eyesight. In the sixth season, Jaqen brings Arya back to the House of Black and White and eventually returns her sight. He orders her to assassinate Lady Crane, and reluctantly orders her death when Arya botches the assassination, but is impressed upon learning that Arya killed the Waif instead. Though he tells her she is now "No One", she asserts her identity as Arya Stark and leaves Braavos.</p>

<p><b>Tommen Baratheon</b> (season 1–2, 4–6) portrayed by Callum Whaary in seasons 1 and 2, and by <a href="/wiki/Dean-Charles_Chapman" title="Dean-Charles Chapman">Dean-Charles Chapman</a> from season 4 onwards. Tommen Baratheon of House Baratheon is the prince presented as the youngest son of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. Like his older siblings Joffrey and Myrcella his actual father is his uncle Ser Jaime Lannister. Like his sister he is good-natured and passive in contrast to his brother Joffrey and is fond of his uncle Tyrion. In Season 2, when Myrcella was shipped off to Dorne as part of a marriage alliance between the Lannisters and Dorne, Tommen wept when his sister left for which Joffrey chastises him. During the battle of the Black Water, he sits with Cersei as she prepares to give him night shade drops for a quick, painless death rather than a brutal one, until Tywin announces that they won the battle. In Season 4 he is present at Joffrey and Margaery's wedding, he also attended Joffrey's funeral for which Tywin proceeds to tell Tommen what makes a good king, ignoring Cersei's angry glares. Margaery later visits Tommen one night where he reveals his pet cat Ser Pounce, as well as the fact that he and Joffrey didn't get along and he and Margaery bond over their mutual relief that they are free of him. Tommen agrees that he'd like Margaery to visit him again. Margaery departs, but not before giving him a kiss on the forehead. A ceremony is held in the Red Keep where the High Septon officially crowns Tommen as king. At Tyrion's trial Tommen excuses himself from the trial, possibly on Tywin's advice. In Season 5 during the wake of his grandfather, Tommen is approached by Margaery, who shares a few close words with the king and holds his hand briefly. All of this is observed by Cersei from afar. Tommen and Margaery later marry and consummate that same night, whereupon Margaery begins to manipulate Tommen into trying to send Cersei home. When he does, Cersei immediately begins scheming to get rid of the Tyrells. After Loras Tyrell is arrested for his homosexuality, Tommen furiously confronts Cersei and demands Loras's release, and tries to speak with the High Septon, though he is impeded by the Faith Militant and refuses to allow bloodshed in front of the Great Sept of Baelor. When Margaery is arrested for lying on Loras's behalf, Tommen considers attacking the Sept to free his wife and brother-in-law, but Cersei persuades him to stand down, and when Cersei herself is arrested, Tommen falls into a depression and goes on a hunger strike, refusing to see anyone. In the sixth season, Tommen attends Myrcella's funeral and confronts the High Sparrow, demanding him to allow Cersei to see her daughter. Later, he officially announces an alliance between the Crown and the Faith, and abolishes trial by combat, having effectively fallen under the High Sparrow's influence. When Cersei destroys the Great Sept of Baelor, killing thousands of people, including Margaery, Loras, Mace, Kevan and the High Sparrow, Tommen witnesses it from his quarters, and, unable to do anything as the Mountain blocks the doorway, he commits suicide by jumping through the window, leaving his crown on the table before doing so. His body is later burned and buried beneath the Sept's ruins, with Tywin, Joffrey and Myrcella.</p>

<p><b>Roose Bolton</b> (season 2–6) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Michael_McElhatton" title="Michael McElhatton">Michael McElhatton</a>. A Bannerman of the North and <a href="/wiki/Lord" title="Lord">Lord</a> of the Dreadfort. The Bolton family have a nasty history of keeping to very old, and barbaric ways, including flaying their enemies alive, and Roose is no exception, being suspected of not feeling any emotion. His cunning makes him a valuable ally, but his unpredictable nature makes him a dangerous one. In Season 2, Roose has declared for the King in the North and serves as a chief member of Robb Stark's war council. In secret, Roose feels the Stark cause is lost due to the fact Robb never once listened or heeded his advice, and so acts to secure Bolton predominance in the North – he sends his bastard son Ramsay to take Winterfell from the Ironborn (for his own amusement, Ramsay burns the castle to the ground and flays the defenders after offering them safe passage), and afterwards claims the Ironborn destroyed the castle and apparently killed Robb's younger brothers Bran and Rickon. In Season 3, Roose works with Walder Frey at Tywin Lannister's request to betray the Starks at Edmure Tully's wedding at the Twins. The ambush results in the destruction of the Stark forces by Bolton and Frey men, and deaths of all three Starks and Northern lords present in Walder Frey's hall – Roose personally kills the King in the North with a single stab through the heart, chiding that "the Lannisters send their regards". For his loyalty he is named Warden of the North by the crown (although Tywin Lannister intends to reclaim the title by marrying his son Tyrion to Sansa Stark, the presumed heir to Winterfell). In Season 4, Roose and his men return to the North where he chastises Ramsay for having tortured Theon, as he was a valuable hostage. He also plans to reconquer his new lands from the invading Ironborn, since Tywin is refusing to help him, while ordering his man-at-arms, Locke, to hunt down and kill the remaining Stark boys and Jon Snow (although Locke is killed by Bran Stark in the attempt). With help from Ramsay and Theon Greyjoy, Roose manages to drive the remaining Ironborn out of the Northern lands, and Roose legitimizes Ramsay as his true son. The Bolton's make their way to Winterfell, although they still face opposition from the Northerners – who are furious with the Boltons for betraying the Starks – and Stannis Baratheon, who aims to rally the North as a springboard against House Lannister rule and bring the Boltons down in the process. Roose has Ramsay married to Sansa Stark the true heir of Winterfell. As Stannis eventually nears, snowbound trapped by a blizzard, he approves of Ramsay's raiding of the Baratheon camp, where they successfully destroys most of their supplies and siege engines, diminishing Baratheon chances of taking the North. Stannis ultimately perishes in the ensuing battle, but Sansa escapes from Winterfell with Theon's help. Roose threatens Ramsay with being disinherited if Sansa is not found. When news reaches him of Sansa's disappearance and the birth of his son with Walda, Roose is killed by Ramsay.</p>

<p><b>The High Sparrow</b> (season 5–6) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Pryce" title="Jonathan Pryce">Jonathan Pryce</a>. A devout and pious man, the High Sparrow came to King's Landing after Tywin Lannister's death to serve the poor, downtrodden and infirm. He quickly amasses a large following, including Cersei's cousin and former lover Lancel, who swarm over the city, ministering to the needy and denouncing corruption. He is first noticed by Cersei Lannister when his followers assault and humiliate the High Septon at a brothel. Although she considers capturing and executing him, Cersei decides to use him in her schemes against the Tyrell family. She pretends to agree with his religious views and appoints him as the new High Septon. She also reinstates what had been a long-defunct military order called the Faith Militant, giving them the legal authority to pursue, torture and imprison anyone whom they believed was defying religious principles, no matter their rank or wealth. She tells him of Ser Loras Tyrell's homosexuality, which leads to his arrest by the Faith an inquest presided over by the High Sparrow. Loras's lover Olyvar gives incriminating testimony, so the High Sparrow has both Ser Loras and his sister, Queen Margaery, incarcerated, the latter for perjuring herself when she lied to protect her brother. Loras and Margaery's grandmother, Lady Olenna, attempts to bribe the High Sparrow into offering clemency and is surprised to find that he is uninterested. After Lancel confesses of his and Cersei's affair and of her role in Robert Baratheon's death, the High Sparrow turns on the Queen mother and has her arrested and imprisoned. When Cersei decides to plead for mercy, the High Sparrow listens to her confession of adultery and, on the condition that she stand for trial for her other sins, permits her to return to the Red Keep but only after she performs a walk of Atonement, in which her hair is cut and she must walk naked through the mob. The High Sparrow soon brings Tommen and Margaery under his influence, effectively becoming the new ruler of King's Landin, but he is ultimately killed when Cersei rigs the Great Sept of Baelor with wildfire and detonates it with thousands of people inside.</p>

Robin Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, is the only child of Jon and Lysa Arryn and a sickly boy doted on by his mother. He is still breastfed despite being well into pre-adolescence, and is mentally and socially maladjusted. He enjoys seeing people executed by <a href="/wiki/Defenestration" title="Defenestration">defenestration</a>, whether they are guilty or not (of note, Robin seems to enjoy seeing <i>anything</i> fall through the moon door, since the first thing he does when Petyr Baelish brings him a toy is to gleefully throw it through the moon door). In Season 1, he is present at Tyrion Lannister's trial, but shows little to no interest in the details and continuously begs his mother to make the "little Lannister baby-man" fly, which would mean Tyrion being executed, although Tyrion is acquitted. In Season 4, he greets Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish as "Uncle Petyr" and meets his cousin, Sansa Stark, for the first time. Lysa later mentions in conversation that Robin and Sansa are to be betrothed. However, tensions arise between them when Robin ruins Sansa's snow castle of Winterfell and Sansa slaps Robin in retaliation. After Lysa is killed, Petyr proposes that Robin be taken on several tours of the Vale so as to prepare him for ruling it one day as its new Lord, though Petyr implies that his intention is for Robin to be killed in the process. In season 5, Robin is being trained in the art of fighting, but lacks the skill and determination due to his upbringing. Petyr leaves him in the care of Yohn Royce. In season 6, Robin is informed of Sansa's escape from House Bolton, and through Petyr's manipulations, Robin gives the order for the Knights of the Vale to aid her and Jon Snow against Ramsay Bolton.</li>

Lysa Arryn (née Tully), currently Mistress of the Eyrie, is the widow of Lord Jon Arryn. Born to the Lord and Lady of the Riverlands, she is the younger sister of Catelyn Stark, Lady of Winterfell, and the older sister of Lord Edmure Tully, Lord of Riverrun. She has grown mentally unstable since the death of her husband, and is convinced that as long as she stays boarded up in the Eyrie she will be safe. Justice for her husband rarely crosses her mind, unless exacting it doesn't mean bestirring herself or her guards from her castle. She is also overly protective of her son, Robin Arryn, which has made him a weak and spoiled child. In season 1, Lysa sends Catelyn a letter suggesting that the Lannisters were responsible for the death of Jon Arryn, which prompts Catelyn to investigate. Tyrion Lannister is later taken before Lysa to face justice for attempting to murder Bran Stark. Though Tyrion is innocent, Lysa appears uninterested in the details and even accuses him of murdering Jon. Lysa loses when Tyrion demands a trial by combat and Tyrion's champion, Bronn, wins. She later receives word that Robb Stark is marching on King's Landing to rescue Ned Stark, who has been wrongfully imprisoned, but fails to tell Catelyn. Catelyn confronts her and pleads for help, but Lysa refuses to provide Catelyn with more men, since her only concern is Robin's safety. By season 3, the Vale has remained untouched by the war, and she is betrothed to Littlefinger, who travels to the Vale to marry her. In season 4, it is revealed that Lysa and Littlefinger have been having an affair for quite some time, and are the ones responsible for poisoning Jon Arryn and (though indirectly) Joffrey Baratheon. When Littlefinger returns from King's Landing with Sansa Stark, Lysa greets her niece warmly and insists on marrying Littlefinger that same day. Later, however, Lysa accuses Sansa of seducing Littlefinger, but when Sansa insists that she did not, Lysa immediately calms down and tells Sansa that she is to marry Robin. However, Lysa catches Petyr kissing Sansa and angrily confronts Sansa about it, threatening to push her through the moon door, but Petyr intervenes and pacifies Lysa, before telling her that the one woman he only truly ever loved was Catelyn, and pushing her through the moon door to her death. Her death is ruled a suicide thanks to lies by Petyr and Sansa.</li>

The Royal <a href="/wiki/Princess" title="Princess">Princess</a>, Myrcella is the younger sister of Prince Joffrey and only daughter of Cersei Lannister. She, like her brothers, is also the child of her mother's brother, Jaime, though she remains unaware of this. Unlike her older brother Joffrey, Myrcella is a kind and good person and enjoys being with her uncle Tyrion who in turn dotes on his niece. As part of an alliance between House Lannisters and Martell, Myrcella is betrothed to Trystane Martell, son of Prince Doran Martell of Dorne, and sent to Dorne as a ward of House Martell. For over two years, she has been a guest and ward of Prince Doran, betrothed to his son, but her position has become tenuous with the death of Oberyn Martell, the Prince’s brother. In season 5, Myrcella is shown at the Water Gardens with her betrothed, with whom she seems to have a good relationship. Unbeknownst to her, she has become a part of Ellaria Sand's plans for revenge although Prince Doran refuses that the young princess be hurt as part of their revenge against the Lannisters. Myrcella is nearly taken by the Sand Snakes but is rescued by the Prince's Guard. She later tells her uncle that she now considers Dorne her home and wants to marry Trystane. A while later, Prince Doran allows her to return to the capital with Jaime on the condition that Trystane accompany them, where he will become a member of the Small Council. On the jetty, about to board the ship, she forgives Ellaria Sand, who unexpectedly gives her a kiss on the mouth. On board the ship, Jaime awkwardly attempts to explain the true nature of his relationship with her mother, to which Myrcella responds that she already knows, having "felt" it for a long time. Jaime embraces his daughter, only to discover in horror that she is bleeding from a poison imbued orally by Ellaria. She collapses and dies in his arms. In season 6, her body is returned to King's Landing and laid to rest in the Great Sept of Baelor. Her funeral is attended only by Jaime and Tommen.</li>

Selyse Baratheon (née Florent) is the wife of Stannis Baratheon who is kept locked in a tower on Dragonstone. She married Stannis sometime before the events of Robert's Rebellion. Selyse is a fervent worshiper of R'hllor and a supporter of Melisandre. She keeps the preserved corpses of her stillborn sons in jars in her chambers, seemingly even to Stannis's disgust, but expresses resentment over their daughter, Shireen, who suffers from greyscale and who Selyse sees as a demon, though she is only stopped from abusing her by Stannis. She later accompanies her husband to the Wall, and is present at the funeral of the Night's Watch brothers who died in the Battle of Castle Black. She later witnesses Mance Rayder's execution and accompanies her husband on the march to Winterfell. After their army becomes trapped in a blizzard, she accepts Melisandre's advice to have Shireen sacrificed as a gift to the Lord of Light, only to recant in the last moments, refusing to stand by as her daughter burns to death. Restrained by Baratheon soldiers, she collapses in screams of agony. The next morning, Selyse hangs herself out of grief.</li>

Shireen is the young daughter of Stannis Baratheon and Selyse Florent. Her face is disfigured by the disease Greyscale, but she is not yet crippled by it. She is a friend of Davos Seaworth and visits him during his captivity at Dragonstone with books, convincing him to teach himself to read, which he does. Though she does not get on well with Melisandre and has a bleak relationship with her mother, she shares a strong bond with her father, who loves her dearly. She later accompanies her father to the Wall, where she witnesses the funeral of the Night's Watch brothers who died in the Battle of Castle Black, as well as the execution of Mance Rayder, and also becomes friends with Gilly and Samwell Tarly. She is sacrificed to the Red God, when Stannis' army is stuck in a snow storm on the way to Winterfell, crying out for her parents who witness her death in tears. This leads to the departure of half of Stannis's army and Stannis losing the battle against the Boltons.</li>

<b><a href="/wiki/Renly_Baratheon" title="Renly Baratheon">Renly Baratheon</a></b> (season 1–2) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Gethin_Anthony" title="Gethin Anthony">Gethin Anthony</a>. Renly Baratheon, <a href="/wiki/Lord" title="Lord">Lord</a> of Storm's End, is the youngest brother of King Robert and Master of Laws in the Small Council. He is popular with the people because he is handsome, jovial, and throws extravagant balls and masquerades. He is not fond of fighting or bloodshed, and would rather make friends than kill enemies. He is secretly the lover of Ser Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers, who convinces him that those qualities make him better ruling material than either of his older brothers. While Robert lies dying, Renly attempts to convince Ned of this, and that the two of them should kidnap Joffrey and rule the realm themselves. However, Ned refuses, so Renly, Loras, and their followers flee south. Once Joffrey becomes King and has Ned executed, Renly challenges his nephew's claim to the throne. Renly declares himself King of the Seven Kingdoms during Season 2 and wins the support of the Baratheon bannermen and the support of other houses, despite Stannis' better claim. He also seals an alliance with the powerful House Tyrell and its bannermen (including Randyll Tarly, father of Samwell Tarly) by marrying Margaery Tyrell. He leads his massive army slowly through southern Westeros, biding his time. Catelyn Stark tries to convince Renly and Stannis to put aside their differences and unite against the Lannisters but it fails as both brothers refuses to give their claim for the throne. On the night before a battle between his and Stannis' forces, Renly agrees to Catelyn to allow the North and Riverlands be an independent kingdom if they allied with him, but on the condition that Robb Stark swear fealty to him. However, Renly is assassinated by Melisandre, who gives birth to a shadow demon and sends it to kill Renly in order to remove him from Stannis' path. Stannis is initially unaware of the nature of Melisandre's crime, and is later visibly shocked and saddened of the role he played in his brother's death, which he visibly regrets.</li>

An old friend of Davos, he now sails for Stannis Baratheon on his ship, the <i>Valyrian</i> and his fleet of thirty ships. He has little patience for those that worship R'hollor – Melisandre's God – since he has traveled the world and seen many gods and has come to the conclusion the only true god is between a woman's legs. He agrees to work with Stannis after Davos promises him and his pirates they will be paid in gold and plunder from King's Landing. Salladhor even goes as far as to request the chance to bed Cersei Lannister after the battle, but Davos refuses, unsure if Cersei will be alive at the time. After the Battle of the Blackwater, he finds Davos stranded on a rock and rescues him, but considers his allegiance broken and departs from Stannis' cause after dropping Davos off at Dragonstone, warning him that the Red Woman will pose a threat to him.

Lord Bolton then adds he chose the fattest bride available and she has made him very rich. In Season 4, she arrives at the Dreadfort with her new husband and his men (having been smuggled back into the North to avoid the Ironborn) and is greeted warmly by Ramsay Snow as "mother". She accompanies the Boltons to Winterfell, and receives Sansa Stark and Petyr Baelish along with her husband and stepson. In season 5 it is revealed that she is pregnant, which makes Ramsay feel threatened for his position as Roose's heir.

In the subsequent battle between Ramsay's forces and Jon Snow's army, he leads the Umber forces into battle and fights Tormund Giantsbane.

<a href="/wiki/Lord" title="Lord">Lord</a> Walder Frey, nicknamed the "Late Lord Frey", is the head of House Frey, Lord of the Crossing and bannerman to House Tully. He is known for outliving his many wives (now on his 8th) and siring over 100 children (both bastard and trueborn). Because the use of the Twins became a strategic necessity for Robb's host, Walder was able to negotiate marriage contracts for his children to Robb and Arya Stark. But during Season 2 Robb broke his word and married Lady Talisa. For this slight, and willing to take advantage of the war's changing fortunes, he conspires with Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton to betray Robb Stark at the wedding of his liege Edmure Tully, which he insists in return for support of his men. Frey hosts the infamous "Red Wedding" at which Robb Stark, his wife and mother are all murdered, refusing to spare Robb even as Catelyn holds Lady Frey hostage and threatens to slit her throat, which she does. He is subsequently granted Riverrun and its lands (though the title Lord Paramount of the Riverlands passes to Harrenhal and House Baelish) and expresses delight to take another young wife, but his house is irredeemably tarnished by the betrayal and House Tully's vassals refuse to submit to his rule. In Season 6, he is outraged when he hears of the Blackfish recapture' of Riverrun and blames his sons Lothar and Black Walder for allowing him to escape. He then orders them to retake the castle using Edmure Tully as a hostage. Though they successfully retake Riverrun with the help of a Lannister host led by Jaime Lannister, Walder is ambushed shortly afterwards by Arya Stark, who slits his throat in revenge for the Red Wedding. In Season 7, Arya uses Walder's face to deceive and poison the rest of his family.</li>

The daughter of Balon Greyjoy and his wife Alannys Harlaw, and elder sister of Theon. She is fierce and proud, and defies traditional ironborn gender roles by commanding her own ship, the <i>Black Wind</i>. When her brother Theon takes Winterfell, Yara tries to convince him to go back with her to the Iron Islands, but Theon refuses. Theon is betrayed by his own men and given to Ramsay Snow, lord Bolton's sadistic bastard son, who brutally tortures and eventually castrates him. Ramsay sends Theon's penis in a box to Balon, with Ramsay threatening to mutilate Theon more unless the Ironmen leave the North, whom Ramsay also threatens to flay living. Balon refuses this, but Yara intends to save her brother of her own accord, taking one ship and fifty of the best killers on the Iron islands with her. In season 4, Yara and her men attack the Dreadfort, but find that Ramsay has broken Theon so badly that he refuses to leave with her and even insists that his name is Reek. Ramsay and his men confront Yara in the dungeon and a battle ensues in which Ramsay frees the hounds and sets them on Yara, who is forced to flee the Dreadfort without Theon, telling her men that Theon is dead. In season 6, Yara contests the Kingsmoot to decide Balon's successor and appears to sway the Ironborn by declaring that she will build the world's largest fleet, but is defeated by Euron, who plans to forge an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen to conquer Westeros. Correctly suspecting that Euron will have them killed, Yara and Theon flee the Iron Islands with their loyalists and the bulk of the Iron Fleet, and head to Meereen to forge an alliance with Daenerys first. After explaining the situation, Yara pledges her forces to Daenerys in return for the Iron Islands' independence. Yara is ordered to sail to attack King's Landing. Her fleet is set upon by ships under Euron's command and she is captured and led in chains through King's Landing.</li>

Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, the third and latest actor to portray Ser Gregor Clegane</div>
</div>
</div>
Ser Gregor Clegane is a huge <a href="/wiki/Knight" title="Knight">knight</a> and the elder brother of Sandor Clegane. Called "The Mountain That Rides", he is known for his incredibly cruel nature and uncontrollable temper. His size and strength make him a fearsome warrior, and he has earned a reputation for cruelty and brutality. He is able to wield a two-handed sword one handed. When they were children, Gregor shoved Sandor's face into a brazier, gruesomely scarring him. In Season 1, Tywin Lannister sends him to raid the Riverlands. Beric Dondarrion is sent to arrest Gregor. When war breaks out, Gregor is given command of Tywin's vanguard and left flank and leads his men through intimidation. In Season 2 he is left to command Harrenhal in Tywin's absence and to find and destroy "The Brotherhood Without Banners", invoking the escape of Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie from Harrenhal. He later abandons the castle after slaughtering the prisoners and is defeated by Edmure Tully at the Stone Mill, but manages to escape back to the Westerlands. Robb chides his uncle, having planned to draw the Mountain into a trap of his own making to be captured or killed. In season 4, Gregor is chosen as Cersei's champion for Tyrion's trial by combat, and fights Oberyn Martell, Tyrion's champion who wants to kill Clegane as revenge for the needless murder of his sister, Elia Martell Targaryen. Oberyn sustains several serious injuries to Clegane with a weapon that is laced with poison, but Clegane kills Oberyn by crushing his skull, while admitting that he did rape Elia, killed her children and enjoyed it, before collapsing from his own injuries. It is later revealed that Clegane has been poisoned with manticore venom, a poison that Oberyn had laced his weapon with, and that he is slowly dying. Cersei enlists ex-maester Qyburn to save him, though Qyburn claims that the procedure will "change" Clegane. The procedure is a seemingly a success, as Gregor has become active again and joins the Kingsguard as a personal knight for Cersei, though the procedure has changed his physical appearance and his behavior. In the sixth season, he continues to act as Cersei's bodyguard to intimidate all those who may bother or mock her. After Cersei destroys the Great Sept of Baelor and retakes power, she has Gregor torture Septa Unella in revenge for Unella torturing her during her time in prison.</li>

<b><a href="/wiki/Kevan_Lannister" class="mw-redirect" title="Kevan Lannister">Kevan Lannister</a></b> (season 1–2, 5–6) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Ian_Gelder" title="Ian Gelder">Ian Gelder</a>. Lord Tywin's younger brother, Captain of his Guard, Ser Kevan Lannister is a skilled warrior but overshadowed by his brother Tywin to whom he is deeply loyal and obedient. Unlike his older brother, Kevan is very amiable and cares more about the safety of his family members even if it will humiliate the family's honour. In Season 1, he is present when Tyrion returns from the Vale and informs him on Jaime's military victories against Tully bannermen. After Jaime's capture, he suggests to his brother that they "should sue for peace" which is immediately refuted by Tyrion who reminds that Ned Stark's beheading prevents it. In Season 2, he sits on a war council in Harrenhal, surmising (correctly) that Robb Stark would not march on Casterly Rock until "at full force" and also suggests that Cersei and her children leave King's Landing before Stannis Baratheon sacks the city but the proposition is countered by Tywin, refusing to surrender the Iron Throne. In season 5, he returns to King's Landing to attend Tywin's funeral alongside his only surviving son, Lancel, who has joined the Sparrows movement, which Kevan disapproves. He later refuses to serve on Cersei's Small Council, in spite her offering him the position of "Master of War", questioning her authority, and returning to Casterly Rock until the King himself calls for him. When his niece is arrested by the Faith Militant for sleeping with his son among other sins, Grand Maester Pycelle summons him back to offer him the position of Hand of the King. He later is present at Cersei's return to the Red Keep, immediately after her enduring Walk of Atonement. In the sixth season, Kevan continues to serve as Tommen's Hand while attempting to deal with the High Sparrow without bloodshed and spurning Cersei's attempts to regain influence in the royal court. On the day of Cersei's trial, Kevan is killed when Cersei has the Great Sept of Baelor destroyed with wildfire.</li>

He served as King Robert's <a href="/wiki/Squire" title="Squire">squire</a>; in which he is clumsy and incompetent in his duties leading Robert to dislike him intensely. In Season 2, Cersei knights him for his part in Robert's death. When Jaime goes to war, Cersei takes Lancel as a lover because he resembles her brother. Tyrion eventually discovers the affair and blackmails Lancel into spying for him. During an attack on King's Landing, Lancel guards Cersei's son King Joffrey Baratheon and takes a serious wound in the fighting, causing him to retreat. When Joffrey later abandons the battle out of cowardice, Lancel pleads with Cersei to let him take Joffrey back to the battle in order to inspire the troops, but Cersei, clearly more concerned for Joffrey than the city, refuses to listen. In season 5, he and his father return to King's Landing to attend Tywin's funeral. Lancel joins the sparrows, a devout religious movement, and apologises to Cersei for the sins they committed together, such as their affair and conspiracy to murder Robert Baratheon. With the re-establishment of the Faith Militant, Lancel abandons his family name and leads the sparrows on a rampage throughout King's Landing, arresting Ser Loras Tyrell in the process. Later, on Littlefinger and Olenna Tyrell's urging, he confesses his own sins to the High Sparrow, which leads to Cersei's arrest. In the sixth season, Loras continues to serve in the Faith Militant. On the day of Cersei and Loras's trial, he is lured by one of Qyburn's little birds to the catacombs underneath the Great Sept of Baelor, where he is stabbed in the spine, rendering him unable to use his legs. He spots a cache of wildfire rigged to explode and crawls towards it, but is too late to stop the detonation and is the first to die.</li>

Trystane Martell is Prince Doran’s son and heir to Dorne. His father betrothed him to Myrcella Baratheon as part of the alliance offered by Tyrion Lannister, then acting as Hand of the King. He and Myrcella later grow to love each other and Trystane offers to ask his father if they can marry immediately. He is struck by Bronn when he and Jaime Lannister arrive to take Myrcella back, but Trystane later shows Bronn mercy and decides not to have him mutilated, satisfied with having Areo Hotah strike him in a similar manner instead. Doran allows Trystane to accompany Myrcella back to King's Landing to take his uncle Oberyn's place on the Small Council, but Trystane's life is put in danger when Ellaria Sand secretly poisons Myrcella just as their boat leaves Dorne. Though Jaime prepares to send him back to Dorne unharmed, Trystane refuses to leave, insisting on being present for Myrcella's funeral, so Jaime instructs him to stay on the boat for his own safety. However, as he is painting funeral stones for Myrcella, he is ambushed and killed by Obara and Nymeria Sand, his own cousins, sent by Ellaria Sand to kill him as part of her coup, though most believe his death was Cersei's doing.</li>

Doran Martell is the ruling lord of Dorne and older brother to the late Prince Oberyn Martell. Unlike his brother, Doran is even-tempered and deliberate. In season 4, he is invited to the wedding of Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell, but due to suffering from <a href="/wiki/Gout" title="Gout">gout</a>, he is unable to attend and sends Oberyn in his stead. After Oberyn is slain by Gregor Clegane, Doran grieves but takes no action, claiming that Oberyn suffered a self-imposed death in a trial by combat, a legal act, and coldly rebutts Ellaria's proposal to harm Myrcella Baratheon to exact revenge on the Lannisters. However, after a skirmish in which Jaime Lannister and Bronn fight with the Sand Snakes over possession of Myrcella, Doran orders all locked up, including Ellaria. He later grants Jaime an audience and agrees to allow Myrcella to return to King's Landing along with his son, Trystane Martell, Myrcella's betrothed, while threatening Ellaria and the Sand Snakes with severe consequences should they defy him again. However, Ellaria later secretly poisons Myrcella despite Doran's warning.

<a href="/wiki/Prince" title="Prince">Prince</a> of Dorne, known as the Red <a href="/wiki/Viperidae" title="Viperidae">Viper</a>. He is the hot-headed younger brother of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear. A renowned warrior and traveler, Oberyn has eight bastard daughters, called the Sand Snakes. His sister, Elia Targaryen, was raped and killed during the Sack of King's Landing by Ser Gregor Clegane. In season 4, Oberyn arrives in King's Landing with his paramour, Ellaria Sand, to attend Joffrey's wedding in his brother's stead, and his meeting with Tyrion makes it clear that he has actually come to take revenge against the Lannisters for their role in the deaths of his sister, nephew and niece. At the wedding, Joffrey dies after being poisoned, and Tywin initially suspects Oberyn of having a hand in the murder since Oberyn has a past with poison chemistry, while Oberyn denies involvement and accuses Tywin of ordering Gregor Clegane to rape and murder Elia. The two reach a settlement when Tywin promises Oberyn a meeting with Clegane in exchange for Oberyn serving as one of the three judges at Tyrion's trial. At the trial, Oberyn implies that he is not convinced of Tyrion's guilt, and openly questions Cersei's testimony and asks Shae why Tyrion would tell her about all of his plans to murder Joffrey if he was the perpetrator. When Tyrion demands a trial by combat and Gregor Clegane is chosen as Cersei's champion, Oberyn volunteers to fight for Tyrion, proclaiming that he will exact his vengeance, starting with Ser Gregor. Martell valiantly fights Clegane, his superior speed making up for Clegane's size, and manages to wound him in the shoulder and the leg, flooring him. Refusing to kill him immediately, Oberyn furiously demands that Clegane admit to raping and killing Elia and her children, and that the order came from Tywin himself. Distracted for a moment, Oberyn is floored by Clegane, who – in a manner self-admittedly paraphrasing the murder of Elia – knocks out his teeth, straddles him and slowly gouges out his eyes, admitting to the rape and murder of Elia before crushing his skull. Tyrion is subsequently sentenced to death, but Oberyn's objective of vengeance was not in vain, since his spear is revealed to have been laced with the deadly venom of the manticore, which is slowly killing Clegane. Oberyn's death, however, throws House Martell into chaos, since Ellaria is driven insane to the point that she kills Myrcella Baratheon, Doran Martell and Trystane Martell (Oberyn's own brother and nephew, respectively) to get revenge against the Lannisters.</li>

Robett is the brother of Galbart Glover, the Master of Deepwood Motte. He succeeded him after Galbart's death in the War of the Five Kings. House Glover were bannermen of House Stark but this changed after the Boltons helped him take Deepwood Motte back from the Ironborn who had captured it. He refuses Jon and Sansa's request for aid against the Boltons, citing his brother's death fighting for Robb, the fact that Robb marching to war in the south provided an opportunity for the Ironborn to capture his castle, in the process killing his subjects and imprisoning his family, and finally the fact that Jon's army is composed primarily of Wildings, who the Northern houses have been fighting for generations. However, after Jon Snow and Sansa Stark successfully recapture Winterfell from the Boltons, with help from Littlefinger and the Knights of the Vale, House Glover becomes sworn to House Stark once more, with Lord Glover apologizing for his previous refusal of aid and crowning Jon the King in the North.</li>

A captain of the Unsullied, a group of eunuch slave soldiers. His name is pronounced "Torgo Nudho" in Valyrian and was chosen by his Astapor slave masters, who choose new names for the Unsullied which are designed to humiliate them and make them think they are not human. Despite this, Grey Worm chose to keep his current name because it was his name on the day Daenerys freed the Unsullied, so he considers it to be a lucky name. He is loyal to Daenerys and doesn't like those who insult her. He develops feelings for Missandei, which appear to be reciprocated, and has a friendly rivalry with Daario Naharis. He is gravely injured in Meereen in an attack by the Sons of the Harpy, but ultimately survives. After Daenerys's disappearance, Grey Worm partially recovers from his injuries and remains in Meereen to help Tyrion Lannister govern the city and maintain peace with the slave masters. When the slave masters go back on the deal and attack Meereen with ships, only to be countered by Daenerys's dragons, Grey Worm kills Razdal mo Eraz and Belicho Paenymion, and later accompanies Daenerys and her retinue on their voyage to Westeros. From her stronghold on Dragonstone, Daenerys sends Grey Worm and his army to take Casterly Rock. The night before Grey Worm admits to Missandei that now he has her to love, he has begun to know what fear is. They make love. Grey Worm expects Casterly Rock to be hard to win and is surprised to find it barely manned: the capture is effected with ease. He then takes his army east and is outside King's Landing when Daenerys and Cersei meet in the Dragonpit.</li>

Ser Barristan Selmy is the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and a member of the Small Council. Known as "Barristan the Bold," he is considered one of the most famous <a href="/wiki/Knight" title="Knight">knights</a> of the Seven Kingdoms. Ned has a tremendous respect for Barristan as he remained loyal to protect the Mad King, Aerys II. He sustained injuries at the Trident which prevented Selmy from taking place in the final battles of the war which ultimately lead to his survival and pardon. When Ned attempts to arrest Cersei and Joffrey, he informs Ser Barristan of Robert's will and tells his men not to harm him. After Joffrey becomes King and has Ned arrested, Cersei and Joffrey force Ser Barristan into retirement despite the Kingsguard being meant to serve for life, and much to his anger, his position of Commander is to be given to Jaime. His honor insulted, Ser Barristan refuses their offer of a castle and servants in recognition of his service and leaves King's Landing. Ser Barristan returns in season 3 where he offers his service to Daenerys as a member of her Queensguard to redeem himself for failing her family. He and Ser Jorah Mormont tend to conflict over what actions Daenerys should use with the former preferring honorable choices while the latter preferring pragmatic choices. Barristan later discovers that Jorah's original purpose was to spy on Daenerys for Robert and Lord Varys, and informs Daenerys, fearing for her safety and leading her to exile Jorah from Meereen on threat of execution. When a resistance movement, the Sons of the Harpy, openly hostile to Daenerys's conquest and politics, arise, Barristan advises the Queen to remain just with her enemies and tells of her own father's crimes and cruel attitude which led to his downfall. He eventually sustains mortal injuries in a fight with a group of Sons of the Harpy alongside Grey Worm even though he managed to slay most of them with prowess. He is mourned by Daenerys as she considered him a loyal friend and his death causes her to retaliate on the Great Masters.</li>

Hizdahr is a slave-trader from the city of Meereen, on the coast of Slaver's Bay, and a scion of the House of Loraq, an ancient and proud line of slavers. He claims to Daenerys Targaryen that his father, who Daenerys ordered crucified, was actually against the crucifixion of children, and requests permission to give his father a proper funeral, which she accepts. Daenerys later has Hizdahr sent to Yunkai along with Daario Naharis as her ambassador to persuade the wise masters there to submit to her rule. In season 5, he returns with Daario claiming to have succeeded, although the masters want Daenerys to reopen the fighting pits in return, which she refuses, though she grants him a position on her Small Council. After Barristan Selmy is killed and Grey Worm seriously injured in an attack by the Sons of the Harpy, Daenerys agrees to reopen the pits and marry Hizdahr to bring about peace, though Daario insinuates that Hizdahr is working with the Sons of the Harpy.

Commonly known as "The Blackfish", Ser Brynden is the uncle of Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure, and a seasoned war veteran. He returns to Riverrun during season 3 before his older brother's death to make amends. He serves as both an adviser and confidant for both his niece Catelyn and grandnephew King Robb Stark. At Edmure's wedding to Roslin Frey at the Twins, Brynden excuses himself from the feast to "find a tree to piss on", and by so doing narrowly escapes the ensuing Red Wedding massacre when the Freys and Boltons betray the Starks. Lord Frey is visibly untouched by the man's absence, while Roose Bolton appears disturbed, aware that Brynden is capable of holding Riverrun (which has been granted to Lord Frey as payment) against the Iron Throne even with its technical lord, Edmure, in captivity. Brynden indeed retakes Riverrun from the Freys and holds it in Robb's name, refusing to surrender even when Edmure's life is threatened. The castle eventually falls when Edmure is allowed inside and gives the order to stand down. Brynden, however, refuses to surrender and chooses to fight to the death. He is later reported dead.</li>

Lady Olenna, better known as "The Queen of Thorns", is the sharp-witted grandmother of Loras and Margaery. Considered Tywin Lannister's female counterpart, Olenna is a matriarch and the real power behind House Tyrell. She has very progressive views where she feels women should be more involved in politics and is accepting of Loras' homosexuality where the people of Reach have no problems with it. After learning the abuses Sansa suffered by Joffrey, Olenna figured out that Margaery could avoid the same fate by using Joffrey's love of violence. Because she is fond of Sansa, and to prevent the other nobles from using her as heir of the North, Olenna secretly plots to have Sansa marry Loras. But her plan is foiled by Loras himself, who accidentally reveals it to Littlefinger's spy. Tywin Lannister gets wind of the plot and stops it by having Sansa marry his son Tyrion and, to secure the Reach, orders Cersei to marry Loras. Lady Olenna is at first against Loras marrying Cersei because she is too old and because of the scandal of her incestual affair with her twin brother, Jaime. Tywin threatens to make Loras join the celibate Kingsguard, which would make Joffrey and Margaery's children the heirs of Reach, Olenna admits defeat and praises Tywin for getting the best of her. In season 4, Olenna conspires with Petyr Baelish to have Joffrey poisoned, to protect Margaery from Joffrey's beastly nature, and advises Margaery to become acquainted with her new match, Tommen Baratheon, Joffrey's younger brother and heir. She returns to Highgarden shortly afterwards. When Loras is arrested by the recently reinstated Faith Militant for his homosexuality, Margaery writes to her grandmother who returns to the capital in order to protect her grandchildren from Cersei's schemes. But, mistakenly believing Loras's arrest was simply meant to humiliate House Tyrell, she helplessly assists to Olyvar's testimony which incriminates her grandson, as well as to Margaery's incarceration for perjuring herself in front of the gods in an effort to protect her brother. She later confronts the High Sparrow without results and has a secret meeting with Littlefinger who, blackmailed by Olenna for his part in Joffrey's death and in order to placate his role in her grandchildren's imprisonment in providing Olyvar to Cersei, gives valuable information about Lancel and Cersei's adulterous relationship. This results in the latter's arrest by the Faith Militant. In the sixth season, Olenna takes steps to free Margaery from the High Sparrow and retake power from the Faith Militant, but the plan is thwarted when Tommen forges an alliance with the Faith and becomes the High Sparrow's new puppet.

Ser Loras Tyrell, known as the "Knight of Flowers," is a highly skilled <a href="/wiki/Knight" title="Knight">knight</a> and jouster. Known across Westeros for his beauty, he is Renly Baratheon's former <a href="/wiki/Squire" title="Squire">squire</a> and secretly his lover. He is widely known throughout Westeros for defeating Jaime Lannister in a jousting match. In Season 1, he charms Sansa Stark before his jousting match with Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane, but even though he wins, Clegane attacks him in a blind rage and he is only saved by Clegane's brother, Sandor, who Loras names as the champion in gratitude. In private, while shaving Renly, Loras makes it clear that he disapproves of both Joffrey and Stannis as Robert's closest heirs, and tells Renly that he would make a great king. In Season 2 when Renly makes his claim for the Iron Throne, Loras and the rest of House Tyrell back his claim and cement their support by marrying Loras's sister Margaery to Renly. Loras and Renly remain inseparable even after Renly's wedding. After Renly's assassination, Loras goes berserk and vows vengeance against Stannis, but secretly blames himself for having pushed Renly to make his claim even though he was lawfully behind Stannis. When the Tyrells join the Lannister cause against Stannis, Loras fights wearing Renly's armor in honour of the fallen king at the Battle of the Blackwater. During season 3, his family plots to have him marry Sansa for Sansa and his family's benefit. However, he accidentally reveals this plot to his new lover and squire, Olyvar, who is actually a spy for Lord Baelish. Tywin stops the Tyrell plot by having Sansa marry his son Tyrion and engages Loras to his daughter Cersei. In season 4, at Joffrey and Margaery's wedding, Loras exchanges banter with Jaime, who warns Loras that if he marries Cersei, she will likely kill him in his sleep, and that he will never marry her. Loras counters that Jaime will not marry Cersei either, implying that he knows of his incestuous relationship with Cersei. He is later present at Tyrion's trial for murdering Joffrey, though he is apparently unaware that his grandmother, Olenna Tyrell, is the true killer. In season 5, he attends Tywin's funeral and offers his condolences to Cersei. He continues his sexual relationship with Olyvar, flirtatiously suggesting that they should move to Dorne, where homosexuality is more tolerated, and expresses doubt that to Margaery that he is still obliged to marry Cersei with Tywin gone. He is later present at Tommen and Margaery's wedding and, during a training session, is suddenly arrested for his homosexuality by the recently reinstated Faith Militant. He denies all of the Faith's allegations against him, including his affair with Renly, during an inquest presided by the High Sparrow, but eventually loses his temper when Olyvar testifies against him, citing his birthmark "in the shape of Dorne" he has on his thigh as proof. This prompts the Faith to incarcerate both him and his sister, the latter for perjuring herself in front of the gods in an effort to protect him, and to open formal trials for them. In the sixth season, after being tortured for almost a year, Loras admits to his "crimes" on the day of his trial and joins the Faith Militant in order to survive and a seven-pointed star is carved on his forehead. Though he is accepted into their ranks, he is killed when the Great Sept of Baelor is destroyed by wildfire on Cersei's orders.</li>

is known as the former First Sword of the Sealord of Braavos, is hired by Lord Eddard to train Arya Stark at "Water Dancing", the Braavosi style of sword fighting. Syrio trained Arya using wooden swords filled with lead. He also mentored her on how to move and think like a warrior: to be perceptive, move with grace, and command her fear. After Eddard Stark's arrest, Cersei Lannister sends men to capture Arya. Syrio orders Arya to run while he holds them off with only a wooden practice sword. He defeats five guardsmen but cannot bring down the armored Meryn Trant, who cuts his practice sword in half. Arya escapes. The fate of Syrio after that is unknown.</li>

is an ex-maester who was found by Robb Stark at Harrenhal. He becomes a servant of Roose Bolton. Qyburn lost his title as a maester when he was caught performing human experiments on live patients. Qyburn justifies his actions for the sake of medical knowledge. He tends to Jaime after the latter loses his right hand and travels with him to King's Landing in the hope of having his title restored. In season 4, Qyburn cures Jaime of infection, allowing the skin to heal fully and has a solid gold hand forged for him, earning him Cersei's respect and gratitude. Cersei later enlists his help in curing Gregor Clegane of a deadly poison inflicted on him by Oberyn Martell in the trial by combat. Qyburn warns that his help may "change" Clegane, but when Cersei asks if it will make him weaker, he enthusiastically implies the opposite. After Tywin's death and Varys's treason and escape, Cersei appoints him the new Master of Whispers, much to Grand Maester Pycelle's disapproval. When the Queen mother is imprisoned by the Faith Militant, he is the only one to visit her and informs her of her uncle Kevan's appointment as the new Hand of the King. When Cersei returns to the Red Keep after her Walk of Atonement, Qyburn warmly greets her and presents her the newest member of the Kingsguard, an undead version of Ser Gregor, the results of his experiments. He sways most of Varys's little birds to his service and learns of the caches of wildfire that the Mad King had stored underneath King's Landing. After Cersei removes all of her enemies by destroying the Great Sept of Baelor with everyone inside and later crowning herself Queen, she names Qyburn as her Hand. At the parley in the Dragonpit, while everyone else is terrified by the wight and horrified when it continues to fight after being cut in half, Qyburn is instead fascinated, picking up the dismembered wight's hand and inspecting it as it twitches.</li>

Pycelle is later revealed to be a spy for the Lannisters, Cersei specifically, and he who informed her of Jon Arryn's investigation of her affair with Jaime. To prevent himself from being undermined, Tyrion has Pycelle arrested and sent to the dungeons, but Cersei frees and Tywin Lannister reinstates him. A deleted scene from season 3 shows that Tywin is not fooled by Pycelle's frail old man guise.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Later on, when he proves unable to save the poisoned Gregor Clegane and openly doubts Qyburn's abilities, Cersei orders him to leave, giving his position to Qyburn. He later attends Tywin's funeral and proposes himself as the next Hand of the King Cersei ignores him and appoints Qyburn as the new Master of Whispers. When Cersei is incarcerated by the Faith Militant, Pycelle summons uncle Kevan from Casterly Rock and gives Kevan him the position of Hand of the King. He is present at Cersei's return to the Red Keep after her Walk of Atonement. He continues to be dismissive towards both Cersei and Jaime, acknowledging that Cersei no longer holds any power. On the day of Cersei and Loras's trial, however, he is lured to Qyburn's laboratory by the little birds and stabbed to death, orchestrated by Cersei and Qyburn.</li>

Ser Meryn Trant is an obedient member of the Kingsguard. He seems perfectly willing to do whatever Joffrey commands, no matter how vile the order. In Season 1, as Eddard Stark is being arrested, he is ordered by Cersei to bring her Arya Stark. Arya's fencing instructor, Syrio Forel, defends Arya from Ser Meryn and is presumably killed. Meryn is present at Tyrion's trial for Joffrey's murder, where he recounts some veiled threats Tyrion had made against Joffrey in season 2, while conveniently omitting that he and Joffrey had been beating Sansa Stark at the time. In season 5, he attends Tywin Lannister's funeral, accompanying Cersei. He is later appointed by the latter to travel as a bodyguard to Mace Tyrell to his meeting with the managers of the Iron Bank of Braavos. In Braavos, he attends a brothel and asks for underage girls. He is ambushed there and killed by Arya.</li>

Despite his continual gloom and doom he is well-liked by the other Brothers in Black, and is one of few Night's Watchmen to have few if any enemies among his brothers. He is part of the expeditionary force beyond the Wall. In Season 3 he is one of the few remaining survivors from the battle at the Fist of the First men and they manage to retreat to Craster's Keep. He fights against the mutineers after the death of Lord Commander Mormont. In season 4, he and Grenn manage to return to Castle Black, but they join Jon Snow on his mission to kill the mutineers. He survives the ensuing battle and is seen dragging Locke's corpse back to Craster's Keep with the other slain Night's Watch brothers. In the wildling attack on Castle Black, Eddison remains atop the Wall on Jon's orders to stop the wildlings from breaching the gate. He sends down flaming oil barrels and ultimately delivers the blow that sends the wildlings retreating by swinging a huge scythe across the Wall, causing the ice to break and sending many falling to their deaths. He lives through the battle and personally burns Grenn's body at the funeral. In season 5, he witnesses Mance Rayder's execution, supports Jon in becoming the new Lord Commander, and drags Janos Slynt into the courtyard when Jon sentences him to die. He begrudgingly agrees to Jon's proposal to rescue the wildlings from Hardhome before the White Walkers can reach them. He accompanies Jon and the Night's Watch to Hardhome and is one of the few who escape the massacre alive. Following Jon's death in a mutiny, he is one of Jon's loyalists who find his body and barricade themselves inside his quarters, refusing to acknowledge Thorne's leadership. Davos Seaworth sends him to fetch Tormund and the wildlings for help, and he succeeds just in time, ordering the mutineers locked up. He witnesses Jon's resurrection by Melisandre, and the mutineers' execution. Jon relinquishes his command to Edd, naming him the new acting Lord Commander.

In the close of season 5, Alliser appears to Jon to deliver word of Benjen's whereabouts, though this seems to be a mere trick, used to lure Jon to an assassination. Benjen returns in the sixth season to save Bran Stark and Meera Reed from a pack of wights, and reveals that he was stabbed by a White Walker, but then stabbed by a Child of the Forest to stop him turning into a White Walker, a process which left him undead and unable to pass through the Wall. He later takes Bran and Meera back to the Wall and bids them farewell. When Jon Snow is stranded north of the Wall, half-frozen and under attack by wights, Benjen rides in and puts Jon on his horse. Before he is killed he holds off the wights for long enough that Jon can escape.</li>

is a <a href="/wiki/Drill_instructor" title="Drill instructor">drill instructor</a> at Castle Black. He fought for Aerys II during Robert's Rebellion and was sent to the Wall as punishment. He is a bitter, cruel, fanatical and hardened man but knows firsthand what it is like to serve in the Night's Watch during the winter. The previous winter, he was caught north of the Wall on a ranging mission and he and the other members of his party were forced to eat the rangers who died in order to survive. Thorne returns in Season 4, now the acting Lord Commander of the Night's Watch following the death of Jeor Mormont, and becomes friends with Janos Slynt. He advocates Jon's execution for his actions in season 3, but Jon is exonerated by Maester Aemon. Thorne later notices that the people like Jon better than him, and will most likely elect Jon as the new Lord Commander, which would make him Thorne's superior. To avoid this, Thorne, on Slynt's suggestion, allows Jon to lead a mission to kill the Night's Watch mutineers in the hopes that Jon will be killed in battle, though Jon survives. Out of spite, Thorne refuses Jon's proposal to seal off Castle Black to stop the wildlings from breaching. When the wildling army arrives, Alliser grudgingly admits to Jon that he should have listened to him, but valiantly leads his men into battle. Alliser personally duels Tormund Giantsbane, but is wounded. He is last seen being taken inside Castle Black for treatment while yelling for his men to continue fighting. In season 5, he has been healed but walks with a limp. He appears to be the leading contender for being voted the new official Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Though he ultimately loses to Jon Snow by one vote in a three-way race, he is named First Ranger by Jon, which he appears to appreciate. When Jon sentences Slynt to execution for insubordination, Thorne briefly blocks Eddison Tollett's way, but quickly abandons Slynt to his fate. After Jon's return from Hardhome, he eventually opens the gate for the incoming wildling refugees, showing deep resentment for the new Lord Commander's ambition to forge an alliance with the wildling tribes. After Davos' return to the Wall, Alliser dispatches Olly with word of Benjen Stark's current state; the ploy is soon uncovered as a mutiny, wherein a disarmed Jon is trapped and stabbed to death. Alliser delivers the first blow, under the call "For the Watch!" and leaves the Lord Commander dying in the snow. Thorne assumes command once again, but only until Edd brings back the wildlings to save Jon's loyalists from death. Thorne is arrested for his treachery, and after Jon is resurrected, he is hanged for treason.</li>

Ois a young boy who lived with his mother and father in a village in the Gift, the land given to the Night's Watch to support themselves. Their village is attacked by a group of wildlings. His father is killed by Ygritte and his mother by Styr. Styr tells Olly that he is going to eat his dead parents and orders him to tell the men of the Night's Watch at Castle Black in an attempt to draw them out into the open. He then releases Olly, who reaches Castle Black and informs the men of the approaching wildlings, in the process befriending Jon Snow. In the wildling attack on Castle Black, Olly shoots and kills Ygritte from behind in revenge for his father. In season 5, Jon takes Olly as an apprentice, mirroring his own father-son relationship with Jeor Mormont. When Jon is named the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Olly is named Jon's personal steward.

He carries the anger of that incident with him into the events of <i>Game of Thrones</i>. In Season 1, he names Samwell Tarly his personal steward because of his intellect and love for reading and tries to convince Jon Snow not to desert the Night's Watch after he hears of his father's arrest and his brother's campaign to save him. At the end of Season 3, when Sam and Gilly return after the mutiny at Craster's Keep, he sends all the ravens of the Nights Watch with messages to all the kings and lords of Westeros asking for help defending the Wall. In season 4, he is present at Jon Snow's trial. Aemon immediately ascertains that Jon is telling the truth and has him exonerated, claiming that he learned how to detect liars merely by growing up in King's Landing. Moments before the attack on Castle Black, Aemon speaks with Samwell Tarly about his feelings for Gilly. After the battle, he delivers a eulogy for the fallen before they are burned. In season 5, Aemon oversees the selection of a new Lord Commander. When Jon Snow and Alliser Thorne tie, Aemon breaks the tie by voting for Jon. He later falls ill, and Jon entrusts his care to Sam, who informs him on his great-niece's exploits in Slaver's Bay. Aemon later dies of natural causes after Jon's departure to Hardhome, spending his last moments with Gilly and Sam, the latter delivering a eulogy at his funeral pyre.</li>

He was bribed by Littlefinger to conspire against Eddard Stark. He later follows Joffrey's orders to murder all of Robert's illegitimate children. Due to his untrustworthiness and brutality, Tyrion has Janos exiled to the Night's Watch. In season 4, he is shown to be at odds with Jon Snow and suggests that Alliser Thorne get rid of him before he can be elected as the new Lord Commander. During the wildling attack on Castle Black, Janos hides in the food storage closet. In season 5, Slynt appears to support Thorne as the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. When Jon is ultimately elected as the new Lord Commander, Janos refuses to obey Jon's orders and insults him. Jon responds by sentencing Janos to death.

<b>Grenn</b> (season 1–4) portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Mark_Stanley" title="Mark Stanley">Mark Stanley</a>, is a brave but not very bright brother of the Night's Watch who joins at the same time as Jon. He was abandoned by his father when he was a child and had to steal to survive. In Season 1, he is initially at odds with Jon Snow, especially after Jon breaks his nose during a training session. Grenn, Pypar and Rast ambush Jon in a shed and threaten to harm him until Tyrion appears and tells them to back off, while advising Jon to sympathise with the other brothers. Jon makes amends by helping to train the others and becomes friends with Grenn. In Season 2, Grenn is part of Lord Commander Joer Mormont's ranging mission. Once they reach the Fist of the First Men, he is ordered to find firewood with Eddison Tollet and Samwell Tarly. In the process, they find a hidden stash of dragonglass (obsidian) daggers. When the White Walkers and wights approach, Grenn and Edd make a run for it, accidentally leaving Sam behind. In Season 3, he is one of the few remaining survivors of the battle at the Fist of the First men. On the way back to the Wall, Grenn makes amends with Sam by helping him walk along with Edd and Rast, and they manage to retreat to Craster's Keep.

In season 4, he and Edd manage to escape from the keep and make it back to Castle Black, but they later join Jon Snow on his mission to kill the mutineers. He survives the ensuing battle and expresses shock at the sight of Locke's badly snapped neck, wondering aloud what killed him. In the wildling attack on Castle Black, Grenn is ordered by Jon to take five men and hold the castle gates. A giant breaks his way in, and Grenn and the others manage to kill it at the cost of their own lives. His body is later burned by Edd at the funeral.</li>

Later, he admits to Jon and Sam that he were merely accused of stealing after refusing the sexual advances of his former lord. In the first season, he is at odds with Jon Snow, who does not hide his superior skills from the other brothers, but he becomes friends with him when Jon, on Tyrion Lannister's advice, helps to train the other brothers. He is later assigned to the stewards. In season 4, Pyp participates in the battle against the wildlings at Castle Black with both a sword and a crossbow.

In season 3, Karl survives the Battle at the Fist of the First Men and accompanies the survivors back to the Wall, stopping by Craster's Keep along the way, where he eyes Craster's daughters. As tensions between Craster and the brothers of the Watch run higher, particularly after they accuse Craster of starving a fellow ranger to death, Karl challenges Craster and later provokes him into attacking, but he stabs Craster through the mouth and inadvertently triggers a mutiny against Lord Commander Mormont. He is tackled by Grenn, but he subdues him and orders him chained up. In season 4, Karl is still at Craster's Keep, lording over it and raping Craster's daughter-wives. His men eventually catch Bran Stark, Jojen and Meera Reed and Hodor on their quest to find the three-eyed raven and hold them hostage when he learns Bran's identity. Karl later tries to rape Meera, but he is stopped when Jon Snow leads a band of Night's Watch brothers to kill the mutineers. Karl fights Jon alone inside Craster's hut and almost kills him by fighting dirty, but he is stabbed in the back by one of Craster's wives.

<b>Rast</b> (season 1, 3-4) portrayed by Luke McEwan, was a trainee to the Night's Watch with a particularly mean spirit. He was arrested for rape and chose the Wall as his punishment. In Season 1, he is at odds with Jon Snow, who does not hide his superior skills while training, and later threatens him in the armoury with Grenn and Pyp, but he backs off when Tyrion Lannister threatens him. Though Jon later trains him and the other recruits, he does not come to respect Jon and expresses jealousy when Jon is given the sword Longclaw by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. He takes every opportunity he can to bully Samwell Tarly and only stops when Jon, Grenn and Pyp threaten him. In season 2, he is part of Mormont's expedition North of the Wall to find Benjen Stark, and fights in the Battle at the Fist of the First Men. In Season 3, he is one of the few remaining survivors of that battle and is shown to be visibly upset and angry at the loss of his comrades, taking it out on Sam until Mormont intervenes. They manage to retreat to Craster's Keep, but Rast grows increasingly angry and resentful of Craster for mistreating them and the others, particularly when a fellow ranger dies of starvation, which Rast attributes to Craster's stinginess. Rast and Karl Tanner stand up to Craster, resulting in a mutiny in which Karl kills Craster and Rast stabs Mormont in the back for threatening Karl with execution. He and the rest of the mutineers remain at the Keep with Craster's daughter-wives, although Sam manages to escape, to Rast's fury. In season 4, he is visibly uncomfortable with the abuse the mutineers are putting Craster's daughters through, and is himself being abused by Karl, who spitefully orders Rast to feed Jon's direwolf, Ghost, who they have caged outside the Keep. When the mutineers capture Bran Stark and his party, Rast recognises Bran as Jon's brother and taunts Hodor by stabbing him in the leg. Rast later flees from the Keep when Jon leads a band of brothers to kill the mutineers, but he is mauled to death by Ghost, whom Bran had freed.</li>

Mance Rayder is a former ranger of the Night's Watch who became the "King-Beyond-the-Wall" and the new leader of the Wildlings. He was a wildling child who was raised by the Night's Watch, becoming one of their best rangers but eventually joining the wildlings. Using the training and tactics he learned from the watch, Mance became the seventh King Beyond the Wall, uniting disparate clans by reminding them that the white walkers and other monsters would kill them all. Mance's goal is to get his people to the safety of the other side of the wall before the White Walkers could reach it. He plans a two-pronged attack on Castle Black, sending Tormund and Jon across the wall with a small party and preparing an army on the other side. After the advance attack on Castle Black fails, Jon leaves Castle Black to hunt Mance down on pretence of parleying with him. Mance realises Jon's true intentions and is about to kill him when he and his men are ambushed and defeated by Stannis Baratheon and his army. Mance and Stannis briefly exchange insults when Mance refuses to acknowledge him as the King. Mance is taken prisoner by Stannis. In season 5, Stannis offers to show Mance mercy if he will bend the knee and pledge allegiance to him, but Mance still refuses, fearing that he will lose his people's respect in the process. On Stannis's orders, Mance is burned at the stake by Melisandre, although Jon shoots Mance to cut short his suffering.</li>

Several members of the Night's Watch finally lose their patience with Craster after returning defeated from a battle with the White Walkers when he insults their dead and refuses to share more of his supplies with the hungry rangers.

is a wildling raider and warg, a human capable of entering the minds of animals. Orell doesn't trust Jon, as he suspects that Jon is still loyal to the Night's Watch; he is also jealous of Jon's relationship with Ygritte. Orell's suspicions are confirmed when, during a raid at the North, Jon refuses to kill an innocent horse breeder. Orell claims that Jon always was a "crow" and a battle ensues. After a few moments of sword fighting, Jon shoves his sword into Orell's chest and whispers "You were right the whole time", before pulling it out and leaving Orell to die. Orell wargs into the mind of his eagle with his dying breath and attacks Jon, but Jon is able to fight him off.</li>

<b><a href="/wiki/Drogon" class="mw-redirect" title="Drogon">Drogon</a></b> (season 1–present) is the black one of Daenerys's three dragons. He is visibly the biggest and Daenerys's favourite dragon. He is named after Khal Drogo, her late husband. Throughout seasons 2 and 3, Drogon is loyal to Daenerys, but in season 4, he roars in her face when she tries to stop him from harming the other dragons over food, which makes her realise that she may be losing control over her dragons. While in Meereen, Daenerys receives two complaints from the citizens of Slaver's Bay about Drogon's behaviour, one of them a shepherd whose flock of sheep Drogon torched, and the second a farmer whose three-year-old daughter Drogon killed. Though Drogon disappears before he can be captured, he saves Daenerys from an ambush in Daznak's Pit and flies off with her on his back, though he is wounded by the Sons of the Harpy in the process.</li>
<li>
<b><a href="/wiki/Rhaegal" class="mw-redirect" title="Rhaegal">Rhaegal</a></b> (season 1–present) is the green one of Daenerys's three dragons. He is named after Daenerys's deceased brother, Rhaegar Targaryen. When Daenerys begins to lose control over them, she locks Rhaegal and Viserion in the catacombs beneath Meereen. She later goes to visit them, but they attempt to attack her, forcing her to flee.</li>
<li>
<b><a href="/wiki/Viserion" class="mw-redirect" title="Viserion">Viserion</a></b> (season 1–present) is the yellow one of Daenerys's three dragons. He is named after Daenerys's deceased brother, Viserys Targaryen. When Daenerys begins to lose control over them, she locks Rhaegal and Viserion in the catacombs beneath Meereen. She later goes to visit them, but they attempt to attack her, forcing her to flee. Viserion is killed with an ice spear during a battle with the White Walkers beyond the Wall, only to be turned into a wight himself by the Night King. With the Night King riding on his back, Viserion breathes blue fire at the Wall and it begins to disintegrate.</li>
<li>
<b>Ghost</b> (seasons 1–6) is Jon Snow's direwolf. He is the <a href="/wiki/Albinism#Other_animals" title="Albinism">albino</a> runt of the litter of puppies, but nevertheless grows into a strong adult. He accompanies Jon to Castle Black. Following the Night's Watch mutiny, he is imprisoned by Karl and Rast. He is later freed by Bran Stark and mauls Rast to death before re-joining Jon and the loyal Night's Watch brothers. Though he is taken back to Castle Black, Alliser Thorne spitefully orders Jon to lock Ghost up. When the wildlings reach Castle Black, Jon orders Sam to free Ghost, and the direwolf subsequently helps the Night's Watch by mauling several wildlings to death. He survives the battle. After Jon departs for Hardhome, Ghost remains at Castle Black and scares off two Night's Watch bullies after they beat Sam and attempt to rape Gilly. After Jon is murdered Davos and the loyalists bring him to help protect Jon's body. Once the mutineers led by Alliser Thorne are defeated and arrested thanks to the Wildlings he rests by Jon's body. Later he is the first to witness Jon come back to life. Once Jon executes the mutineers and reunited with his sister Sansa Ghost leaves Castle Black with Jon. He doesn't participate in the battle against the Boltons. After the Starks win, he returns to Winterfell with Jon.</li>
<li>
<b>Summer</b> (seasons 1–4, 6) is Bran Stark's direwolf. When an assassin attempts to kill the comatose Bran, Summer tears out his throat with his teeth, saving both Bran and his mother Catelyn. Summer and Shaggydog survive the sacking of Winterfell and join Bran, Rickon and their group on their journey to the Wall to find Jon Snow. When they stumble across Craster's Keep, Bran mentally takes over Summer's body to scout the area, but Summer falls into a trap and is imprisoned. He is later freed and continues the journey north with Bran. During the battle with the skeletons outside the three-eyed raven's cave, Summer mauls several and escapes with Bran into the caves. After the White Walkers and the Wights attack the tree, the group is forced to escape. Only Meera and Bran make it out alive as Hodor, Summer, The Children of The Forest and the Three-Eyed Raven are all slain by the undead while giving Bran time to escape.</li>
<li>
<b>Shaggydog</b> (season 1–3, 6) is Rickon Stark's direwolf. Following the sacking of Winterfell, Shaggydog and Summer join Rickon, Bran and their group on their journey to the Wall to find Jon Snow.

<li>
<b>Nymeria</b> (season 1, 7) is Arya Stark's direwolf. <a href="/wiki/The_Kingsroad" title="The Kingsroad">On the way to King's Landing</a>, Joffrey attacks Arya in a play-fight taken too far.

A very long time after, Arya reunites with her while in the Riverlands on her way back home to Winterfell, and she learns that she has since joined a pack of wild wolves. She attempts to urge her to return with her. However, Nymeria refuses, likely due to how long she has been away from home, and remains with her new pack.</li>
<li>
<b>Grey Wind</b> (season 1–3) is Robb Stark's direwolf. He accompanies Robb on his campaign against the Lannisters and often fights alongside him in the War of the Five Kings.
